    <h1>GnoRPM</h1>

    <p>GnoRPM is a graphical front end to the RPM package management
    system.  I wrote it and maintained it up til the end of 1999
    (around the 0.9 release).  A screenshot of an earlier version can
    be found <a href="gnorpm-0.6.gif">here</a>.  You can find GnoRPM
    here:</p>
 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnorpm/">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnorpm/</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that GnoRPM is targetted at the Gnome 1.x libraries, and
    doesn't support the latest versions of rpm yet.  You might want to
    look at <a href="../nautilus-rpm/">Nautilus RPM</a>
    instead, which I am developping on and off.</p>
