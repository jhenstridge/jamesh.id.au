    <h1>The WWW-SQL Home Page</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This page contains information about WWW-SQL, which is a
    program written by me (<a href="mailto:james@daa.com.au">James
    Henstridge</a>).  It is used to display information from MySQL or
    PostgreSQL databases in web pages.  It does this with a simple
    embeded scripting language.  The commands are embedded in special
    HTML tags, so it should be passible to edit the document with an
    HTML editor.  The tags are evaluated when the page is loaded, so
    the resultant page will be HTML compliant (assuming the original
    was mostly compliant).</p>

    <h2>Mailing List</h2>

    <p>There is a mailing list for discussion of www-sql.  You can
    subscribe at the lists web page at <a
    href="http://www.daa.com.au/mailman/listinfo/www-sql">
    http://www.daa.com.au/mailman/listinfo/www-sql</a>.</p>

    <h2>Current Version</h2>

    <p>The current version is 0.5.7.  It doesn't add any new features
    if you don't use the new scanner.  If you have been testing it,
    you will find support for while loops.  Here is the relevant
    section of the Changelog:</p>

<pre>
www-sql-0.5.7:  17-November-1998
        - Fixed a small inconsistency between the new and old scanners, so
          that the new one recognises &lt;!SQL as well as &lt;!sql.
        - Made the new scanner the default for compiles.  You can use the old
          input scanner with the --without-new-scanner argument to configure.
        - Added a sentance to the ftime function documentation to clarify that
          the offset is given in seconds.
        - Now AFFECTED_ROWS and INSERT_ID are set for failed queries (to 0 and
          -1 respectively).
        - Added the uinclude command.  It is identical to the include command,
          except that it is executed unconditionally (even if shielded by an
          if statement).  This may be more useful to some people.
