www-sql-0.5.7:  17-November-1998
        - Fixed a small inconsistency between the new and old scanners, so
          that the new one recognises <!SQL as well as <!sql.
        - Made the new scanner the default for compiles.  You can use the old
          input scanner with the --without-new-scanner argument to configure.
        - Added a sentance to the ftime function documentation to clarify that
          the offset is given in seconds.
        - Now AFFECTED_ROWS and INSERT_ID are set for failed queries (to 0 and
          -1 respectively).
        - Added the uinclude command.  It is identical to the include command,
          except that it is executed unconditionally (even if shielded by an
          if statement).  This may be more useful to some people.

www-sql-0.5.6:  15-September-1998
        - Fixed a small bug that was reported to me by a few people.  With the
          new scanner linked in, the cmdIf function was not setting the
          looping member of the if stack structure.  This is now fixed.  I
          suppose the new code should work well for most people now.

www-sql-0.5.5:  4-September-1998
        - Apparently some web servers (BOA in particular) don't always set
          the QUERY_STRING environment variable in GET queries.  This is now
          checked for.  This may have been what was causing the small problems
          for Netscape servers as well (getting errors if there was no ? in
          the URL).
        - Fixed a fatal bug in cmdQuery (the query command) that meant that
          no query handles could be accessed correctly (the bug was caused
          by a bit of code that freed some memory, allocated it to the
          new query handle, then used the first variable again, corrupting
          the query handle structure).
        - Added the const keyword in a few places.

www-sql-0.5.4:  31-August-1998
        - In cmdFree (both myqsl and pgsql versions), I accessed a variable
          just after it had been freed.  Although it didn'tcause any trouble
          for most systems, it is now fixed.
        - Added a missing semi colon in if.c (problem only showed up with
          --with-new-scanner)
        - Added an error message for <!sql print_rows>.  It was missing before.
        - fixed a few memory leaks.
        - Fixed the HTML escaping for new lines -> "<br>", when the browser
          sends "\r\n" strings.  This was pointed out by Malte.
        - Fixed a bug in the print_loop code when you have a result with
          zero rows in it (it would be picked up as an error, rather than
          skipping down past the corresponding <!sql done>.  This bug was
          found by Malte, but I made a few changes to make sure it really
          picks up real errors (which is what the original code was supposed
          to do).

www-sql-0.5.3:  21-July-1998
        - Made it so that the buffer used to perform variable expansions is
          dynamically expanded as needed.  This will prevent many of the
          buffer overrun errors found when printing BLOBs.
        - Added an optional third parameter to the qselect command.  You can
          now give a default value for the list box.
        - Added an implementation of the include command for use with the
          new scanner.  This means that the new scanner should have all the
          functionality of the old one.
        - Added a while command.  It is only available when using the new
          scanner (this is because it uses features that weren't available
          in the previous scanner).  It acts as you would expect.  Open
          command with <!sql while expression> and close with <!sql done>.
          There is also a <!sql break> and <!sql continue> commands to help
          with the looping control.
        - Added a print_loop command, which is like the print_rows command,
          but you can put any commands between <!sql print_loop qhandle> and
          a <!sql done> command.  This should be useful as an alternative to
          recursive mode.
        - Removed old expression parser from main distribution.  Along with
          this, also removed --with-old-expr and --with-sysvregex arguments
          for configure.  No one should have problems with this, since they
          have had more than six months to tell me about any bugs in the newer
          code.
        - Added inline keyword to parts of the new scanner.  It adds a small
          amount to the binary, but it may increase the speed of the scanner
          a little.  (I have used autoconf's macros to check which inline
          keyword to use, and if it exists at all, so this is portable).  Also
          fixed some bugs in the expression tokenising in this new scanner
          (I was comparing characters against 0 rather than '0').

www-sql-0.5.2:  24-June-1998
        - Fixed error in manual about cookies.  Leaving out an expiry date
          prevents a cookie from being saved between browser sessions.
        - Added -lcrypt to link flags for www-pgsql.
        - Changed code for --enable-apache-action-check, so when it is used
          without an apache server, it has no effect.  This way it can be
          safely used for a binary distribution.
        - Started work on a new input scanner.  Currently, it can't do
          anything more than the current one, but once it is complete, it
          will allow me to add a while loop, and proper macro expansion of
          command output.  So if you want these features, please test this
          scanner for me.  It is enabled with the --with-new-scanner switch.
          Also, this scanner handles quotes better (eg ab"cd\""d"b" is a
          valid string, and "\\" recognises the second quote -- before it
          was being escaped by the second slash).

www-sql-0.5.1:  15-May-1998
        - Added an include statement.  This include statement works inline,
          and doesn't require the recursive extension. (The initial idea for
          this feature was from Alexey I Onin <alexey@vtau-bsd.pstu.ac.ru>,
          but the final implementation is based on code submitted by
          Malte John <malte@ddd.de>).  Unless --enable-unsafe is passed
          to configure when building www-sql, you can only include files
          in the same directory as the script.
        - Added some new functions submitted by Malte John <malte@ddd.de>.
          They are exec (only enabled if compiled with --enable-unsafe)
        - Added cookie support (code submitted by Lars Bensmann
          <lars@skynet.e.ruhr.de>).  Cookies sent by the browser are converted
          to www-sql variables (like form variables).  Cookies can be set by
          making your script output code like:
            <META http-equiv="Set-Cookie" content="name=value;expires=Friday,
                31-Dec-99 23:59:59 GMT; path=/">
          (All on one line).  You can leave out the expires part if you want.
        - Added a function ftime.  It is basically an strftime wrapper.  The
          first argument is a format string.  The function uses the current
          time to create the string.  If you give a second argument, it is
          used as an offset from the current time.  (eg <!sql ftime "%c"
          +3600> will print the time, for one hour in the future).  This
          function should be useful for setting the expire time on a cookie.
        - Fixed bug where if you had a variable names 'a' and one named 'abc',
          www-sql would give different expansions of "$abc" depending on the
          order that the variables were defined.  Now it picks the longest
          variable name.  If you relied on the old behavior, you will have
          to change your script.  This change is based on a patch submitted by
          Eduardo Trapani <etrapani@unesco.org.uy> (his patch only fixed the
          problem for mysql query handles -- I made the changes for pgsql and
          general variables).
        - Fixed configure script so that the --with-pgsql-libs argument
          produced the correct linker option.  (It was producing a -I,
          instead of a -L)
        - Added some better error checking for the connect and database
          commands in the mysql version.
        - Got rid of all direct references to members of the MYSQL structure.
          The code now uses the accessor functions and macros.
        - Got rid of some constructs that did not cause errors in gcc, but
          gave trouble with Solaris's compiler (and other ones with less
          extensions to ANSI/ISO C).
        - Fixed bug in URL encoding for characters with codes greater than 127.
	- Added check for alloca, so that compiling regex.c works on non-gcc
          compilers.

www-sql-0.5.0:  23-Feb-1998
        - Added PostgreSQL support.  Now you can give configure the argument
          --with-database=dbname, where dbname is eithe mysql or pgsql.
          You can also pass configure the arguments --with-pgsql-headers
          and --with-pgsql-libs, which act like the mysql equivalents.
          To build both binaries, run "make www-mysql www-pgsql".
          (Maybe I should do an mSQL version of www-sql).
        - Updated the documentation to give some idea of how to set up
          www-sql under PostgreSQL.
        - Made the QUERY_STRING environment variable available to www-sql
          programs.
        - In the connect function, the host, username and password values are
          checked for variable expansion now.
        - Fixed the security hole described by Christophe Leroy on the bugtraq
          mailing list.  This hole allowed the bypassing of security on a web
          server, allowing the reading of password protected files.
          If you are using apache, and altered the configuration files as
          described in the documentation (to allow *.sql files to be handled by
          www-sql), then by passing the argument --enable-apache-action-check
          to configure, you can seal this leak.  I recommend that most people
          use this switch.

www-sql-0.4.4:   6-Feb-1998
        - This is just a small patch for people having trouble with the regex
          support in the expression parser.  Even if www-sql was using the
          platform's regex library, it was using the GNU regex header file
          included in this distribution.  This could cause problems related to
          the field layout for the pattern structure, causing core dumps.
          It is probably not necessary to get this version if you are using
          GNU regex already (or haven't used the regex features of www-sql).
        - Updated the documentation with additional examples that demonstrate
          inserting and deleting data from tables.  (Maybe less people will
          mail me about how to do this).

www-sql-0.4.3:  27-Jan-1998
        - Fixed yet another bug in the new expression parser.  Before, it
          wasn recognising brackets as strings, rather than their correct
          interpretation.  This is now fixed.  (I hope this is the last big
          bug in the new expression parser -- if you find any more, PLEASE
          tell me).
        - Fixed bug where fields of a query that were null would sometimes
          print unexpected characters.  In this situation, it now just doesn't
          print anything.  (I think this bug snuck in with the previous
          release.)
        - Split the file func.c into three files -- func.c now only handles
          functions not specific to the database, cmds.c contains substVars
          and executeSql, and mysql.c contains all the MySQL specific code.
          It should now be possible to replace this file in the linking stage
          to get www-sql to work with a different database system
          (eg. PostgreSQL, mSQL).
        - Now when you make an SQL query, the variable INSERT_ID gets set to
          the last auto increment insert id.  This should be useful for
          authentication or user tracking.

www-sql-0.4.2:  22-Jan-1998
        - Fixed some more bugs in the new expression parser.  The first bug
          involved expressions such as `number = string' where number evaluates
          to a number and string is a string.  These would always return true
          when they should return false (strings are basically anything that
          can't be converted to a number).
          The second bug was in the parser, and meant that you couldn't use the
          exclamation mark to mean `not'.
        - Updated the example file example.sql -- it now URL escapes variables
          before inserting them into URLs.  I have also fixed some bugs that
          were introduced into the script by recent enhancements to www-sql.
        - Simplified some of the code in the function substVars in func.c.
          These changes may increase the speed of some operations, and makes
          $var is a synonym for @var, and $qh.field is a synonym for @qh.field.
        - I have had some reports from some people that compilation fails when
          the code tries to use the macro IS_NUM.  There is now code to define
          this if it hasn't been defined by the mysql headers.
        - Added convert function for compatibility with W3-mSQL v1.x.  This
          procedure isn't really needed, since you can use the "?varname"
          syntax.
        - Changed the sql escaping so that it doesn't escape SQL wildcards '%'
          and '_'.  If you don't want to have wildcard matches, you should use
          the '=' operator rather than the 'like' operator in your SQL
          statements.  If you don't like this change, please tell me.

www-sql-0.4.1:  27-Dec-1997
        - Realised that I had forgot to put string comparison functionality
          into the new expression parser (oops).  This is now fixed.  I
          recomend everyone using version 0.4.0 upgrade to this version.
        - Added fixes for some of the problems in the new expression parser.
          previously choke on commands such as `$var = "-"', since it was
          interpreting the - as a minus sign instead of as a string.
          This version allows all symbols like the `-' to be considered as
          strings as well.  It also contains string comparison code as well
          (eg `a < b').  It also checks numbers better (eg `1a' is not
          the same as 1).
        - Fixed typo in README file (the word Password was repeated).  Thanks
          to who ever told Hamish (the Debian package maintainer).
        - Included the file www-sql.spec, which can be used to help make an
          rpm for www-sql.

www-sql-0.4.0:  15-Dec-1997
        - Wrote a new expression parser.  It is used by default, but if you
          need a feature of the old parser, it is available by adding the
          argument --with-old-expr to configure.  If you do have trouble with
          this new expression parser, please mail me so that I can fix the
          problem.
          The main new feature of this parser is that it handles floating
          point numbers, making www-sql more useful for shopping cart type
          applications.
        - Added two new string escape schemes.  These will work on both
          variables and query handle fields.  By prepending the variable with
          a '?', you will escape the string using MySQL's rules.  This is
          useful in <!sql query> statements, since it protects your scripts
          from some user input.  As an example, the following command would
          give an error if the variable's value was ':
             <!sql query "insert into table values ('$a')">
          But by using ?a instead of $a, the statement will work.

          The other escape scheme is `HTML escaping'.  This is just converting
          &, <, > and " to their respective entities.  This is most useful in
          <!sql print> and <!sql print_rows> commands.
        - Added two new options to configure: "./configure
          --with-mysql-headers=<dir>" is the same as "MYSQL_INCDIR=-I<dir>
          ./configure", and "./configure --with-mysql-libs=<dir>" is the same
          as "MYSQL_LIBDIR=-L<dir> ./configure".

www-sql-0.3.4:  04-Nov-1997
        - Added more CGI variables to www-sql's environment.  You can now
          access the values of GATEWAY_INTERFACE, HOSTTYPE, HTTP_HOST,
          HTTP_REFERER, HTTP_USER_AGENT, OSTYPE, PATH_INFO, PATH_TRANSLATED,
          REMOTE_USER, SERVER_ADMIN, SERVER_NAME, SERVER_PORT, SERVER_PROTOCOL
          and SERVER_SOFTWARE.  If a variable is not set when www-sql is run,
          it won't be available to the www-sql script.  Also added the builtin
          variable WWW_SQL_VERSION, which is a string holding the version
          number of www-sql.
        - Didn't forget to update the documentation this time.
        - Increased the readability of the dumpvars command.
        - Added a setexpr command.  Allows you to assign the value of an
          expression to a variable.  The syntax is <!sql setexpr var expr>.
        - Altered all the commands so that they output to the file handle
          yyout instead of stdout.  This is mainly to make the recursive
          support easier.  If you have written any extra commands, you should
          change occurences of printf(...) to fprintf(yyout, ...)
        - Added recursive extensions to www-sql.  Adapted from code submitted
          by Simon Cocking <simon@ibs.com.au>.  Basically, www-sql will expand
          www-sql tags like normal, but will the resulting page back into
          www-sql, to expand more tags.  This process continues until there are
          no more www-sql tags.  To enable this option, add the argument
          --enable-recursive to configure.
        - Added an elsif (else if) command to www-sql.  From code by David
          J. N. Begley <d.begley@uws.edu.au>.
        - Added detection of cgi-bin directory at /usr/local/roxen/cgi-bin and
          /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin (Apache's new default).

www-sql-0.3.3:  09-Oct-1997
        - Added some automatic detection of Solaris libraries (either
          '-lxnet' or '-lsocket -lnsl')
        - Added url encoding of normal variables as well as query handles
          (from code submitted by Karsten Blees <blees@dcon.de>)
        - You can now reference query fields as @query.fieldname (ie. by name
          rather than by number).  From code by Karsten Blees <blees@dcon.de>.
        - Added detection of cgi-bin directory at /usr/local/web/cgi-bin

www-sql-0.3.2:  26-Sep-1997
        - Added the argument --with-sysvregex to configure to get www-sql to
          use the SYSV style regex libraries instead of POSIX style libraries.
          Note that the actual libraries are not included, and I haven't
          this code (it was submitted by Todd Koeckeritz <toddk@mapp.org>)
        - Added the ability to url encode a query result field by using a
          hash (#) instead of an ampersand (@) to reference it. (based on
          code submitted by Todd Koeckeritz <toddk@mapp.org>)
        - Fixed up checking of return values from getenv.  (It should be more
          helpful in narrowing down wierd errors).
        - Removed the file error.c, and adjusted xmalloc.c so it didn't need
          it.  This should reduce the problems with compilation on FreeBSD.
        - Now compiles with both Berkeley's pmake and GNU make.

www-sql-0.3.1:  19-Sep-1997
        - Included the GNU regex library in the lib directory.  Maybe this
          will fix the FreeBSD problems.
        - Added <!sql qselect> to create a drop down listbox for forms.
        - Added error messages for when commands fail.  This should make
          debugging scripts a lot easier for simple problems.
        - Apparently someone got this program working on Irix, so I can now
          definitely say www-sql is portable.

www-sql-0.3.0:  01-Sep-1997
        - Fixed up configure script so it finds alternate mysql lib locations
          properly, and caches the value.  Same for mysql headers.
        - Cleaned up CGI parameter code.  Also fixed the setting of variables
          REMOTE_HOST and REMOTE_ADDR (It didn't work before).
        - Fixed <!sql query> so that it will work for queries that don't return
          result bodies, like insert and update.  With these queries, no query
          handle is created.
        - Added <!sql dumpvars> -- it dumps the names and values of all www-sql
          variables.  This can be used for debuging scripts.
        - Added the commands Qtable and Qlongform, which make printing of the
          results of a query easier.  They were contributed by Martin Maisey
          <M.J.Maisey@webname.com>.
        - Added builtin variable AFFECTED_ROWS, which gives the number of rows
          affected by a query.  (-1 for SELECT queries).

www-sql-0.2.2:  19-Aug-1997
        - Fixed up some more bugs in the documentation (swaped the words
          action and addhandler in the apache setup section)
        - removed the staic lib kludge, and fixed the problem. (Thanks go to
          Leroy Cristophe <leroy@meg.fr> for pointing out the problem).
        - altered the configure script so that it would link with libm and
          libmysqlclient during the tests.  This should stop the configure
          script failing on some machines.
        - Added two extra builtin variables -- REMOTE_HOST and REMOTE_ADDR,
          which have the same values as they do in a CGI script.

www-sql-0.2.1:  28-Jul-1997
        - fixed up some of the documentation
        - made configure look in more places for mysql libraries.
        - added --enable-static-lib-kludge to configure as a hack on
          systems where www-sql doesn't link properly.  I will have
          to find the real reason, and fix it properly.
        - altered the makefile to reflect other changes.

www-sql-0.2:
	- first public release.
