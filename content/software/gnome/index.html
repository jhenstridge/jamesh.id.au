GNOME stands for GNU Network Object Model Environment.  It aims to create
a user friendly desktop environment based entirely on free software.  For
more information on GNOME itself, please see
<a href="http://www.gnome.org">The GNOME website</a>.

<p>
This page has some information about GNOME programs I have written.  They
are all under development, but are still useful and useable.

<a name="gnome-python"></a>
<H2>gnome-python</H2>
gnome-python is a set of bindings for the gnome libraries.  It contains the
<a href="../pygtk/">PyGTK</a> package, which is also written by me.  It
is available in source form from:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-python/1.99/">ftp.gnome.org:/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-python/1.99/</a>
  </ul>

<a name="gnorpm"></a>
<H2>GnoRPM</H2>

<p>GnoRPM is a graphical front end to the RPM package management system.
I wrote it and maintained it up til the end of 1999 (around the 0.9
release).  It has not been ported Gnome 2.0 or RPM 4.1, so is not yet
usable on the latest Linux distros.  Some screenshots of earlier
versions can be found <a href="gnorpm-0.6.gif">here</a> and <a
href="gnorpm-0.5.gif">here</a>.  You can find GnoRPM here:

  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnorpm/">ftp.gnome.org:/pub/GNOME/sources/gnorpm/</a>
  </ul>

<a name="libglade"></a>
<H2>Libglade</H2>

Libglade is a library that performs a similar job to the C source
output routines in the <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/">GLADE user
interface builder</a>.  Whereas GLADE's output routines create C code
that can then be compiled, libglade builds the interface from an XML
file (GLADE's save format) at runtime.  This way you can change the
look of a program without needing to recompile.

<p>Currently it supports all the widgets in current releases, together
with support for keyboard accelerators and automatic signal
connection.

<p>It is available from:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libglade/2.0/">ftp.gnome.org:/pub/GNOME/sources/libglade/2.0/</a>
  </ul>

<a name="gnome-vnc"></a>
<H2>Gnome-VNC</H2>
Gnome-VNC is a GNOME viewer for
<a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">Virtual Network
Computing</a> servers.  VNC allows you to view and use the desktop of
windows machines, and the display of the special Xvnc X server accross
networks.  The protocol is stateless, and multiple viewers can look at
and interact with a single VNC display (good for presentations).
<p>Currently gnome-vnc is only available from my site, as it contains
some simple DES encryption routines, which are necessary to perform the
password authentication.  I replaced the original encryption routines
that came with the VNC distribution with a modified version of the DES
code in <a href="http://www.samba.org">Samba</a> (in fact I crippled
the code further, so it has even fewer entry points, and is incapable of
generating reverse key schedules used in decryption).  So gnome-vnc is as
legal as samba.  Make up your own mind about whether you are allowed to
use it.
<p>It is available from:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.daa.com.au/pub/james/gnome/">ftp.daa.com.au:/pub/james/gnome</a>
  </ul>
