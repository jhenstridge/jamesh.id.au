When the Ubuntu Phone project was cancelled, I moved to the desktop
team.  The initial goal for team was to bring up a GNOME 3 based
desktop for the Ubuntu 17.10 release that would be familiar to both
Ubuntu users coming from the earlier Unity desktop, and users of
"vanilla" GNOME 3.

My main focus has been on improving the user experience of [snap
packaged applications](https://snapcraft.io) on the desktop.  This has
involved both improvements to the snapd package manager itself and
tools used to build snap packages.
