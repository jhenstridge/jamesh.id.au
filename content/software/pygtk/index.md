PyGTK is a set of bindings for the GTK widget set.  It provides an
object oriented interface that is slightly higher level than the C
one.  It automatically does all the type casting and reference
counting that you would have to do normally with the C API.

For more information on PyGTK, see its home page at
[www.pygtk.org](http://www.pygtk.org/).
