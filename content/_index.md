This is the personal website of James Henstridge.  I work
for [Canonical Ltd](https://www.canonical.com), currently as a member
of the [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) Desktop Team.

On this site, you'll find [software I have
written](software/_index.md) over the years.  In addition to my work
on Ubuntu and related projects, I worked on the GNOME project for many
years, and served on its foundation board of directors for two years.

There is also supporting material from [various
talks](talks/_index.md) I have presented at conferences.

There's also some really old stuff like my old [Java fractal
applets](/fractals/) that probably don't work in modern browsers.
