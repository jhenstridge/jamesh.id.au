Hello.  My name is James Henstridge, and I work for [Canonical
Ltd](https://www.canonical.com) on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net).

One of my hobbies is programming.  I am involved in a number of [free
software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/) projects including
[Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/).

You probably want to look at some other parts of my
website:

* [Material from talks I have given.]({{< relref "talks/_index.md" >}})
* [Some articles I have written]({{< relref "articles/_index.md" >}})
* [Java fractal applets](/fractals/)
