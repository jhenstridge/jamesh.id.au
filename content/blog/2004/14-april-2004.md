[**ViewCVS**](http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/)

After the breakin at the gnome.org web server, the CVS server were moved
over to the new server HP donated. However, the LXR and Bonsai tools
weren\'t considered as high a priority, so have not been restored yet.

Since it was easier to set up than either LXR or Bonsai, I set up
ViewCVS (with [jdub](http://www.advogato.org/person/jdub/)\'s help), so
we now have online repository browsing again. It doesn\'t provide all
the features found in the other packages, so it\'ll be good to get them
set up again too though.

We made a few superficial changes to the templates to make them look a
bit more gnomey, but they probably still need a bit more work.

**jhbuild**

Merged a patch to add an optional `"make clean"` phase to jhbuild, and
added a `"make check"` phase (also off by default). These should be
useful for the unattended \"tinderbox\" mode.

It does increase the complexity a bit, so I think I\'ll have to look at
how to simplify it a bit (probably pull a bit more of the logic out of
the program code).
