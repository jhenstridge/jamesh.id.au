**Mataró**

I\'ve been in Mataró (about an hour from Barcelona) now since Sunday,
and it\'s quite a nice place. It is a bit cooler than Perth due to it
being the middle of Winter here, but the way most of the locals are
rugged up you\'d think it was a lot colder. It\'s great to catch up with
everyone, and a number of pygtk developers will be turning up over the
next few days for the BOF on the weekend.

**Gnome Foundation Elections**

Congratulations to [the new board
members](http://foundation.gnome.org/elections/2004/preliminary-results.html).
It is a little disappointing that only about 56% of members voted
though. Once the membership committee has the anonymous voting stuff set
up, it might be worth doing the preferential voting referrendum.

**jhbuild**

I\'ve been working on some preliminary documentation for JHBuild, which
is available [here](http://www.gnome.org/~jamesh/jhbuild.html). It
should be useful for new users and people looking at writing new module
sets for it. It has a fairly complete command reference and config file
reference, so it is probably useful for current users too. It would be
good to add some information about setting up a tinderbox like [the one
Luis set up for Gnome](http://gnome-build.ximian.com/tinderbox/LATEST/).
