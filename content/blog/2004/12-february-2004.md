**jhbuild**

Had a pretty good response to the jhbuild changes. There was a number of
problems I didn\'t catch during my testing (more that I would have
liked). However, I think I caught the last few ones with
[pychecker](http://pychecker.sf.net/).

I suppose the next thing to do is to help the
[fd.org](http://www.freedesktop.org/) guys set things up so they can
manage their module sets from their own CVS tree. That will make it
easier to recommend as a build tool.

It is also almost at a stage where it could be packaged as a tarball to
be used for building Gnome developer snapshots. (Jeff has said that this
might be easier than updating garnome).

**Creative Commons**

I was looking around on the creative commons website, and came accross
[this
page](http://creativecommons.org/projects/founderscopyright/oreilly).
Essentially, O\'Reilly is planning on licensing their current books
under an effective 14 or 28 year copyright (pending author approval).

In addition to that, they say they are planning on releasing their out
of print books under an attribution license straight away (again,
pending author approval). I was looking over the list of books on the
page, and the out of print list included the X series. I have a couple
of books from the series, and they have been quite useful.

It looks like they started this a while back and haven\'t gotten very
far, but it would be very useful once the rest of the X series is
available.
