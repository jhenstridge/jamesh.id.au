**[louie](http://www.advogato.org/person/louie/)**: doesn\'t the fact
that the introduction of a third credible candidate causes problems is
in fact a problem in itself?

There are vote counting schemes in use that don\'t penalise similar
candidates, such as the [single transferable
vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) system used in
Australia to elect MPs. Rather than splitting the vote, the votes for
the least popular candidate\'s votes get transferred to their second
preference. This process gets repeated til there is a candidate with a
clear majority. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system
where a minor candidate does more harm for their cause than good.

It\'s due to similar reasons that I\'ve brought up switching to the
[multiple seat version of
STV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Transferable_Vote) (which is
used for Australian senate elections) for the [Gnome
Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/) elections.

**Guantanamo Bay**

It feels really weird to agree with John Howard. There are currently two
Australian citizens who have been held at Guantanamo bay for over two
years without being charged (one of them wasn\'t even in the war zones
\-- he was captured in Pakistan). Apparently the US will only release
them to Australia on the condition that they be prosecuted.
Unfortunately neither person committed any crime under Australian law as
it was at the time.

We now have Mark Latham offering to support the Government if they want
to change the new terrorrism laws to allow them to be applied
retrospectively to the two. This seems like such a bad idea at so many
levels (think about the precedent). It doesn\'t look like that will be
happenning though, since John Howard rejected the offer.

Maybe the US will get a new sensible president, and the situation will
get resolved sensibly. Maybe not.
