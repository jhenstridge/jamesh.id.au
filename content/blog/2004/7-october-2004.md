**Elections**

Tomorrow is the Australian Federal Election. It is weird how there are
some topics that none of the parties seem to have been bringing up
during the election. In particular, they don\'t seem to be mentioning
about how John Howard lied about the [children overboard
scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_overboard_affair) last
election (if he didn\'t lie, then he intentionally kept himself
uninformed which is possibly even worse). This was a case where
information was suppressed until just after the election had finished.
If the information had been made public, it could have changed the
result of the election.

Hopefully by the end of Saturday we won\'t have a Prime Minister who
isn\'t a
[spamer](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/0,2000061791,39157473,00.htm)
and [telemarketer](http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2004/s1213161.htm).

[**Jamin**](http://pubcrawler.org/archives/000524.html): from what those
articles say, Michael Moore was offering incentives for people to vote
--- not incentives to vote for a particular candidate. While I agree
that the latter is bad, why is encouraging people to vote bad?

In the Australian elections, I\'ve received a postal vote application
from my current MP. While I think it would be better if the applications
were sent out by the [AEC](http://www.aec.gov.au), I don\'t think there
is anything wrong with encouraging people to vote in this way.

Also, even if you don\'t consider yourself a Bush supporter, the people
who manage the websites you referenced certainly are. If you want to
accuse someone of being a propagandist, perhaps you should choose some
less obviously biased news sources.

[**Hub**](http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?m=200410#07): there is a
preference to get Thunderbird to check all IMAP folders for new
messages. It just isn\'t exposed in the UI. Instructions for turning it
on can be found
[here](http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/tips.html#beh_downloadstartup).
