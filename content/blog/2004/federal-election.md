So the [Federal election](http://www.aec.gov.au/election2004/index.htm)
has been announced for 9th October. If you are an Australian living
overseas, now would be a good time to apply for a postal vote. It\'d be
great if this gets rid of [John Howard](http://www.johnhowardlies.com/).
Of course, even if he does win he will probably retire soon after the
election \...

Last week, it also turned out that John Howard is [a
spammer](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/27/pm_spam_slam/). He paid
his son\'s company to send out unsolicited email to members of his
electorate. Apparently our anti-spam laws [include exceptions for
political
parties](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/0,2000061791,39157480,00.htm),
so it might not be illegal. However, the Labor party are chasing it up
[whether it was legal for a third party to send out the
spam](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/0,2000061744,39157688,00.htm)
(since they don\'t have the protection of the exemption). On the
brighter side, it might encourage the politicians to rethink whether the
exemptions in the Spam Act are a good idea or not.
