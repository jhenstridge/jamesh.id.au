**Mataró**

The conference has been great so far. The PyGTK BoF on the weekend was
very productive, and I got to meet Anthony Baxter (who as well as being
the Python release manager, wrote a cool VoiP application called
[Shtoom](http://www.divmod.org/Home/Projects/Shtoom/)). There was an
announcement of some of the other things
[Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) have been working on, which has
been reported on in [LWN](http://lwn.net/Articles/115459/) (currently
subscriber only) among other places.

Over the weekend, I had a little time to do some tourist-type things in
Barcelona. I went to [La Sagrada
Família](http://www.sagradafamilia.org/). It was a great place to visit,
and there was an amazing level of detail in the architecture. You can
walk almost to the very top of the cathedral, and see out over the
Barcelona skyline (and see various bits of the cathedral not visible
from the ground). I\'ll have to put my photos up online.

[**Bazaar**](http://bazaar.canonical.com/)

I\'ve been using using Bazaar a bit more at work, and it is becoming
quite usable, compared to `tla`. It is a little interesting using daily
builds of `baz` from the 1.1 development branch, where some features
appear, get renamed or removed as they get developped, but it has a few
more useful features not found in the 1.0 release. From a user point of
view, it feels like the command line interface for `baz` is being
designed to be easy to use, while `tla`\'s feels like they made choices
based on what was easy to implement.

I built some Fedora Core 2 `i386` builds of the 1.0.1 release, and some
1.1 snapshots that are now up on the Bazaar website in case anyone wants
to try them. When I get back home and install FC3 onto my AMD64 box (it
only has Ubuntu on at the moment), I\'ll do some FC3 `x86-64` and `i386`
builds too.
