Today was the first day of the mini-conferences that lead up to
[linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/) later on this week. I arrived
yesterday after an eventful flight from Perth.

I was originally meant to fly out to Melbourne on the red eye leaving on
Friday at 11:35pm, but just before I checked in they announced that the
flight had been delayed until 4:00am the following day. As I hadn\'t
had a chance to check in, I was able to get a pair of taxi vouchers to
get home and back. I only got about 2 hours of sleep though, as they
said they would turn off the baggage processing system at 3am. When I
got back to the airport, I could see all the people who had stayed at
the terminal spread out with airplane blankets. A little before the
4:00am deadline, another announcement was made saying the plane would
now be leaving at 5:00am. Apparently they had needed to fly a
replacement component in from over east to fix a problem found during
maintenance. Still, it seems it wasn\'t the [most delayed Qantas
flight](http://www.theage.com.au/travel/qantas-delays-flight-for-10-hours-20090119-7k6p.html)
for that weekend and it did arrive in one piece.

As I had planned to spend a day in Melbourne visiting relatives, it
didn\'t cause any problems with the flight on to Hobart. I had been
invited to the \"Ghosts\" dinner, which was to start about an hour after
my flight landed, so it was a bit of a rush to get to the university
accommodation and then walk down the hill to the restaurant.

The dinner was pretty good, with organisers from all the previous LCA
conferences plus the people organising the 2010 conference.
Unfortunately, I was the only one from the 2003 organisers able to
attend. It sounds like the 2010 organisers have things in hand, and the
location should be great.
