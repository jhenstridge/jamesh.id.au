I\'m in Montreal through to the end of next week.  The sub-zero
temperatures are quite a change from Perth, where it got up to 39°C on
the day I left.

The last time I was here was for [Ubuntu Below
Zero](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBelowZero), so it is interesting
seeing the same city covered in snow.
