Seven days till my birthday. I checked in the starts of\
the new plugins API for dia. This code reduces the number\
of entry points in a plugin to two. It should also allow me\
to write a nice plugin manager dialog where you can turn off\
loading of plugins if you want (this will be more important\
as we get more heavy plugins such as the python plugin).
