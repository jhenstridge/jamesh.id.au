Today is my 21st birthday. It looks like I am getting
some Lego Mindstorms stuff, which should be interesting.

The custom shape code in dia now has a proper distance
algorithm. This should get of the bugs where sometimes
clicking on one object causes another one close by (which
happens to be implemented with a custom shape) to be
selected.
