In response to [sad](http://www.advogato.org/person/sad/)\'s remarks\
about the [trust metric](http://www.advogato.org/tmetric), yes it is\
really a respect metric. It only has the name trust metric\
because the original use for the algorithm was encryption\
key webs of trust. Advogato was an experiment using the\
same algorithms for a respect metric. I think
[raph](http://www.advogato.org/person/raph) mentioned this in some of
the\
early advogato articles.

Looking at doing the expose/redraw code for\
DiaCanvasView\'s. I am implementing this with Federico\'s\
nice UTA manipulation routines from eog. The routines are\
GPL, but as Federico was talking about using them in\
GnomeCanvas, he probably won\'t mind relicencing to LGPL in\
the future.

Alex is focusing on the renderer interfaces It is an\
interesting problem where you want to cache data (eg. SVPs\
for a libart based renderer) on a view by view basis, but\
don\'t want to add any special case code for a particular\
renderer to canvas items.
