More work on ExtensionClass based pygtk. I now have an
almost finished code generator that will convert files in
Havoc\'s new defs format to ExtensionClass based wrappers.
There are a few problems, but it is mostly working.
Handling of plain functions is partly done as well.

I should apply some of the fixes people have sent in to
the HEAD branch of pygtk. I should also look at fixing the
gettext.py bug for catalogs created on big endian
machines.

It got up to 37 degrees C today. Very hot.
