Have started using Sawmill as my window manager. It\
feels quite nice and is very configurable. I am sure I\
could easily waste hours getting it to act exactly how I\
want it to :)

Have started working on the new ExtensionClass based\
pygtk code. It is on the *extension-class-branch* of\
pygtk in CVS. Currently there is not much to see other than\
a program to convert header files to Havoc\'s new defs file\
format and a program to merge changes from one defs file\
into another (needed because the header parser is not\
perfect and there is some info that is just not included in\
C headers). There is also a bit of code in pygtk/gtk/ (I am\
rearanging some of the modules to be nicer to the module\
namespace, and friendlier to case insensitive platforms such\
as win32). Code generator comes next.

A new SVG draft came out. It includes stuff about\
\`Exchange SVG\'. Maybe it would be good to use it for the\
shape files in dia instead of the current method using style\
attributes.
