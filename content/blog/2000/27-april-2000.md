I went to the show put on for Science Week by Dr Karl Kruszelnicki and
Adam Spencer last night. It was very interesting to hear about the
weird things some people research. If you have a chance to see them in
another state, go.

One interesting thing in the show was when they were pointing out [one
of the
sections](http://scaletext.law.gov.au/html/comact/10/5967/1/CM005070.htm)
in the GST\^H\^H\^HNew Tax System act:

> For the purposes of making a declaration under this
> Subdivision, the Commissioner may:
>
> -   treat a particular event that actually happened as not
>     having happened; and
> -   treat a particular event that did not actually happen
>     as having happened and, if appropriate, treat the event as:
>     -   having happened at a particular time; and
>     -   having involved particular action by a particular
>         entity; and
> -   treat a particular event that actually happened as:
>     -   having happened at a time different from the time
>         it actually happened; or
>     -   having involved particular action by a particular
>         entity (whether or not the event actually involved any
>         action by that entity).

On the bright side, hardware will drop from 22% tax to 10% tax and
software will go from 0% to 10%. Good thing I use free software :)
Maybe this will make a laptop a bit more affordable
