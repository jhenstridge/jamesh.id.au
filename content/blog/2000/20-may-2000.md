Went to see the movie Looking for Alibrandi last night\
with some friends. It was a pretty good movie, and I\
recommend seeing it.

Put out a new release of dia, and a few problems were\
found fairly quickly. One weird one was finding that the\
libart in released gnome-libs was different from the one in\
CVS. It was different enough so that the AM\_PATH\_LIBART\
macro in CVS failed on released gnome-libs. There were also\
a few other minor problems I will fix soon.

The cover on the Kraftwerk Expo 2000 CD is pretty cool.\
It has that bumpy plastic on the cover so the image changes\
as you move it.
