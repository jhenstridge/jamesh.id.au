The river is still toxic. There were hardly any boats\
out on the river today. It is not surprising that there\
weren\'t many small boats (you wouldn\'t want to risk falling\
in), but there didn\'t seem to be many larger boats\
either.

Thought a bit about buying my own set of scuba gear.\
This will be easier than sharing the sets with the other\
rovers down at Pelican Point.

As for dia, I posted something about some of James Cape\'s\
suggestions for the UI of the toolbox to the list. Not many\
people liked the idea of having seperate windows for each\
sheet. I can\'t say I like the idea that much.
