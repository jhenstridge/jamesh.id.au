Haven\'t posted anything here for a while. We released a\
new version of dia. Some of the features are not complete,\
but for most things, it is more stable than the last\
version. I also updated the web site this time :)

Still looking into using
[ExtensionClass](http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/)\
in pygtk/gnome-python. I wasn\'t able to find any info on\
subclassing ExtensionClasses from C and didn\'t get any\
response from Jim Fulton, so I went ahead and added the\
feature myself. I posted the patch to Jim and the zope-dev\
list for anyone else who may want it. I hope it gets\
included, as I don\'t want to end up maintaining a fork of\
ExtensionClass. This looks like it will greatly reduce the\
amount of hand coded stuff found in pygtk, which will be\
good.

There are a number of patches that I have to integrate\
into pygtk. I will look at that soon. I should also make a\
new release of libglade as well.
