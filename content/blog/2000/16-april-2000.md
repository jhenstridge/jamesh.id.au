Had my 21st birthday party yesterday (the actual birthday
is tomorrow though). It was pretty good, although we ended
up with the same amount of swan gold as we started with (you
can\'t even give that stuff away). Maybe this was also
because we had some good beer as well.

Thanks to everyone who came, as I had a great time.
