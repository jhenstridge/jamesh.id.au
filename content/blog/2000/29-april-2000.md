More work on new canvas. Started work on the update and
render code for DiaCanvasItem and DiaCanvasGroup classes.
Some of these parts of the current GnomeCanvas code feel
like spagetti code, so hopefully this new canvas should be
more maintainable. The event code still needs to be hooked
up. Soon I may actually be able to start testing things a
bit.
