Been talking with [Andrei](http://www.advogato.org/person/andrei)
about getting gtk bindings for php working. He will
probably be using some of the ideas from my python
bindings.

Got the first few chapters for a book I will be tech
reviewing. They are doing everything with MS office tools,
which is a bit of a pain. Abiword is nowhere complete
enough to do the job, as it doesn\'t do the revision control
stuff needed. Gnumeric is probably good enough for the
spread sheet work. This is the part I hate most about the
MS monopoly \-- they have a monopoly on how you can access
the information. Dealing with Havoc\'s book was a lot
easier, as he convinced them to let him use a text format
(XML). I guess I better put a copy of msword on the old 486
then.
