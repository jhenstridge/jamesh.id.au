I released a new version of dia on sunday. Didn\'t get\
everyone\'s patches in, but I thought it was important to get\
another release out because of how long ago the previous\
release was. Of course, after doing the release someone\
finds an XIM bug, I notice that the SVG CR has been put out\
(so the recommended namespace URI\'s have changed) and I\
didn\'t tell the translators about the release. So I will\
probably put out another release of dia soon with these\
fixed.

Tomorrow (9th August) is my parents 25th wedding\
aniversary.
