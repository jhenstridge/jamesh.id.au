I don\'t know what all the fuss is about the gnome\
steering commitee thing. The main job we are doing is doing\
a bit of release coordination, so things get done on time\
(for october gnome, Elliot did most of this work, but it is\
probably less stressful to have a group of people doing the\
work). The other stuff discussed was about starting the\
process of creating a gnome foundation (which should take\
over a lot of what steercom was set up for).

Did more work on pygtk/extensionclass. It is starting to\
feel like the old pygtk. I am trying to track down some\
weird errors that are occuring when deallocating instances\
of python subclasses of GtkObject wrappers. I think I am\
the only person who has tried to do this kind of weird stuff\
with ExtensionClass. I think it has something to do with\
the evil wraper rescue code in pygtk\_dealloc `:(`

It looks like my certification of
[advogato](http://www.advogato.org/person/advogato/) pushed him up to\
master `:)`
