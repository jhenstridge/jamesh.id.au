The CDDB hash function has a high rate of collisions for\
single track CDs. Using the [freedb.org](http://www.freedb.org/)
database, the\
RH6.2 source cd comes up as *In the corridor of\
uncertainty* by *Flacco and the Sandman*.

On the dia list, we have been discussing writing a new\
canvas for using in GTK/GNOME applications as a replacement\
of GnomeCanvas. It will take all the good points of the\
current Dia canvas (internal handling of multiple views,\
abstract rendering interface meaning only a single draw()\
routine is needed which can handle GDK, Libart, gnome-print,\
etc backends) with the benefits of the GnomeCanvas (based on\
GtkObject system, arbitrary transformations, etc).\
Depending on how things turn out, we may submit it for\
inclusion in GTK+. More info when we work out what we are\
going to do.
