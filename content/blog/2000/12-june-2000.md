Did my first exam today. It was differential topology.\
As there are only two people doing the course, I either got\
top or bottom mark :) Two more exams to go and then the\
break.

We switched ISPs on friday. I am sure that our previous\
ISP was saturating their network with the internet phone\
call service they started up a while back. At times,\
performance was really bad. Things are half working with\
the new ISP. We can reach just about everywhere except most\
perth ISPs. I will have to look into this.

After Hans\'s new plugins are tidied up, I will look at\
doing a new release of dia. The new version has a fixed\
polygon shape, a beziergon and working tearoff menus among\
other things. Quite a bit nicer to use than 0.85.
