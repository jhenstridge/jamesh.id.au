Have been upgrading my system for the past few days. I\
got a nice new 20GB hard drive. When I was installed it,\
everything was working fine, but part way through the\
install of Red Hat the system would turn itself off.

While checking all the things I had changed, and trying\
bios upgrades, I got to a stage where the system would turn\
off as soon as you powered it up. I eventually worked out\
that the power supply was pretty much dead (not overloaded\
\-- I don\'t have that much in my case), so I moved everything\
into one of the spare boxes and everything (including the\
new hard drive) works fine. The new case has three fans,\
and is a bit noisy. I should probably unplug one of them\
(they are all hooked up to the motherboard, so I wonder if\
you can tell the motherboard to turn them off :-)

I also turned on DMA for the hard drives and it makes a\
big difference when compiling stuff. I am currently\
upgrading things to a more usable state (ie. gnome stuff\
with debugging info turned on).

I should put out a new pygtk and gnome-python. I will\
switch them over to using CVS automake and libtool rather\
than automake-1.4 + my patches. I put out a test release of\
the ExtensionClass based pygtk on my ftp site. I really\
like the new code, and it will be good to move the rest of\
pygtk and gnome-python over to that codebase.
