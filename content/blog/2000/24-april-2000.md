Been hacking on the new dia canvas. The stuff is in the\
dia-newcanvas module. I am currently working on some of the\
DiaCanvas / DiaCanvasView interactions, which is\
interesting. Hopefully the canvas will be useful to other\
people doing multi view canvas stuff. It should also add\
minimal overhead to people doing single view stuff (do same\
sort of initialisation as for GnomeCanvas, but also create a\
view), and you get transparent print support.

I got legOS to work with my lego. I should post the RPMs\
I made to the Red Hat contrib archive. Being able to write\
real programs for the RCX is a lot better than using the\
provided software. From the legOS docs, it says you can\
send any IR message to another RCX, including ones such as\
\`erase firmware\' :)
