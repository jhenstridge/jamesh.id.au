One more exam tomorrow (computer vision), then mid year\
break.

I think someone has been distributing binaries of dia\
with gnome-print support (which is broken). This has\
resulted in a lot of complaints and bug reports about the\
print support not working correctly. I hope it isn\'t the\
Helix packages with gnome-print support enabled.

It seems like no one who submit bug reports bother to\
take the time to check if the bug has already been\
reported. It is very frustrating to get lots of reports\
about the same bug. It is not as bad as reports about bugs\
in old versions of a package that have been fixed in the\
latest version or \"it crashed\" reports with no info on what\
the problem was. A little extra effort on the part of the\
person submitting the report can be very helpful to the\
developers.
