Wrote some code to convert arbitrary elliptic arcs to
bezier curves for the gnome-print driver in dia. This
should stop people sending bug reports in about that
problem. The output looks very nice, so no one should
notice that it isn\'t real elliptic arcs. I was talking with
Chema about adding support for arcs in gnome-print itself,
possibly using my code as a fallback for drivers that don\'t
support them.
