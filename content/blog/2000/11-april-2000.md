There was another GNOME steering committee meeting last
night. This one was one hour earlier, which was unexpected
but nice (the last one started at midnight). This probably
had something to do with the daylight saving (something we
don\'t have to worry about over in western australia, as it
confuses the cows (yes that was one of the reasons people
voted no in the referendum \-- the cows would get confused if
they were milked at a different time)).

Comitted a plugin manager dialog to dia. You can now
disable plugins if you want. It seems I got unsubscribed
from the dia mailing list, which is a pain. The list seemed
a bit quiet recently.
