As I have been pretty much house bound for the past two
weeks, working on my dissertation, I ordered a few cd\'s from
[78s](http://www.78records.com.au/) (one of the
best music stores in Perth) over the internet. Very good
service, and the much faster than other places I tried.

Got a copy of the new Turnstyle record Geek Party. It is
a good compilation.

Looks like they sold
[Fatso](http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=451336332&ed=970318879)
for AU\$80,450. [Eric
Moussambani\'s](http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=443791326)
goggles sold for a fair amount as well.
There is a nice quote from him on the auction page at
ebay.
