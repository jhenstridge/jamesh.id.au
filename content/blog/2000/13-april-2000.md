I have been looking through what was installed when I did the upgrade
from RH6.1 to 6.2. It looks like it installed a lot of kde stuff
during the upgrade without asking (there wasn\'t any kde stuff
before). A bit annoying, but not too bad. What was annoying was when I
tried to install a new gnome-core RPM I had just built, and I get the
following message:

    file /usr/share/gnome/apps/.directory from install of gnome-core-1.1.8-20000413 conflicts with file from package kdebase-1.1.2-33

This seems fairly odd. Why would a file in `/usr/share/gnome/apps` be
part of kdebase? So I decided to check what actually is in kdebase:

    $ rpm -ql kdebase | grep gnome
    /usr/share/applnk/gnome
    /usr/share/gnome
    /usr/share/gnome/apps
    /usr/share/gnome/apps/.directory

On closer inspection, the file is a slightly different format from the
one with gnome-core. Also, the one in the kdebase RPM doen\'t contain
all the translations that are in the gnome-core version.

Looking at the spec file for kdebase, the file was added by whoever
made the RPM. I think I will file a bug report about this.
