Put together some slides for the workshop talks at
[GUADEC](http://www.guadec.enst.fr). I have put\
them up on the web at <http://www.daa.com.au/~james/slides/>\
for anyone who wants to read them.

I put out new versions of libglade, pygtk and\
gnome-python yesterday. The new libglade version contains\
bonobo support from Michael Meeks. The other two were\
mostly bug fixes.
