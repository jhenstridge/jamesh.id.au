Got a message from [jwz](http://www.jwz.org/)
on [dia-list](http://www.mail-archive.com/dia-list@lysator.liu.se/).
He had a few interesting ideas for dia. I don\'t know how
soon we will be able to implement them.

Did a little more work on libglade. Should probably do a
new release soon. Should also release new pygtk and
gnome-python before going to GUADEC.

Today was very humid rather than being very hot.
