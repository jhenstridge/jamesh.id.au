I got my new notebook, and installed Linux on it. It is\
mostly working. The only real problem I have had is with\
resuming from a hibernate when I was in X. With X in 32-bit\
mode, the display gets garbled. With 16-bit mode, the whole\
machine locks up. Changing to another VT before hibernation\
avoids the problem. I wonder if XFree86 4.0 would fix the\
problem? It is probably caused by the Compaq bios not\
saving enough of the state on the graphics card (enough for\
the windows drivers but not enough for XF86\_Mach64)

I was also upgrading another Linux box, and the installer\
caused an exception just after installing all the packages,\
so I had to set up the last few things by hand. A bit\
annoying but not too difficult to fix.
