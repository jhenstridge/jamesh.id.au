Thought I would see what the [Advogato trust
web](http://www.advogato.org/person/graph.dot) looked like\
with graphviz. I would not recommend anyone else doing\
this, as it takes longer than I wanted to wait. Running it\
on just the purple lines finished in reasonable time, but\
ghostview was not usable with such a large single page PS\
file.

Someone suggested adding support for graphviz. As\
graphviz is not open source (despite what they say they\
believe in their licence faq), we can\'t link it with dia.\
If I get around to doing this, it would probably involve\
modifying graphviz to export the data in an easily readable\
format, and getting the import filter to read this data\
through a pipe.
