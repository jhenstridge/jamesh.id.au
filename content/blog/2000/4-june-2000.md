Finished upgrading [quoll](http://www.daa.com.au/) today. It is now a\
Pentium 200MMX, which means it is now not the slowest\
computer in the office (not that you would notice \-- it can\
do a lot more than the NT boxes). I switched over the\
mailing lists to [mailman](http://www.list.org/),\
which looks very nice. It feels nice having newer software\
on that machine.
