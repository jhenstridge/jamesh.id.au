Haven\'t written anything here for a while. I put out\
another snapshot of the ExtensionClass based pygtk. It is\
available at
<ftp://ftp.daa.com.au/pub/james/python/pygtk-0.7.0-unstable-dont-use.tar.gz>.\
Features this release has over the previous one are keyword\
argument support, better GtkCTree support and some other\
changes so that the examples now work with minimal\
modification. I am getting close to the main gtk module\
being feature complete, and since most code is\
autogenerated, the switch to gtk+-1.4 should be fairly\
painless and hopefully quick.
