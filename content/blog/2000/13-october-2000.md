I went to see [The Dish](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0205873) at the\
cinema last night. It is a very good movie, and I recommend\
watching it. Apparently the release date is next week, so\
this was an advanced screening. They also had advanced\
screenings in Perth for Chopper back when it was\
released.

People have started putting in their nominations for the\
gnome-foundation board elections. We have enough candidates\
for an election to be necessary. None of the Sun guys have\
nominated yet. Maybe they will now that the OpenOffice\
source code has been released.
