They have an [ask\
slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/04/05/1118230&mode=thread)
story on slashdot at the moment that seems to\
be asking the question:

The comments range from incorrect opinions and\
suggestions about how to get round the GPL to sensible\
messages from people such as Bruce Perens. Slashdot is\
definitely not what it once was (both that a story like this\
would even be on the front page, and the comments people\
posted).

I wonder how that peer press idea is comming along. It\
has the potential to provide a good news service and make\
sure crud like that doesn\'t get propagated.
