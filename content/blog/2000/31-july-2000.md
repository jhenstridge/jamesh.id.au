I should put out a new release of Dia soon. The next\
release will be the first release as an official part of the\
GNU project, which is pretty good. Lots of nice user\
interface improvements. Just one more feature before the\
release :)

Over the weekend, we pulled through a few CAT5 cables in\
the house. By putting the cable through the wall cavity\
there is no coax running through the doorways anymore. This\
should also reduce the problems of trying to find out which\
computer\'s network card has gone crazy when the network\
stops working.

The Sun open office source release should be\
interesting. Some of the details are still being thrashed\
out, but things look good. In a worst case senario, the\
code will be released under GPL, so we can grab all the good\
features and integrate them into existing apps :)
