There is something weird about bug buddy or the gnome bug
system. I am getting unrelated bugs from different people
posted as followups for bug
[\#3500](http://bugs.gnome.org/db/35/3500.html). All
the followups have been posted with bug-buddy 0.6 or 0.7.
It is getting quite annoying (and yes I have reported the
problen: [\#8144](http://bugs.gnome.org/db/81/8144.html))

Also
got a message from someone wanting help installing
libglade, because he can\'t install Unreal Tournament without
it :)

The GNOME mailing lists are really slow. There is
almost
three days between sending a message and it getting posted
to the list.

I checked in a correct distance function for the
custom
shape code. Now all the custom shapes in dia are actually
shaped with respect to selection (before they were all
rectangular as far as selection was concerned).
