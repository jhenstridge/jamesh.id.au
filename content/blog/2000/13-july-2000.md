I saw the xmen movie on thursday (it was released [a day\
earlier](http://us.imdb.com/ReleaseDates?0120903) here, compared to the
us). It was pretty good,\
and the ending looked like they are expecting a sequel or\
something.

I finally got round to ordering the my laptop, so it\
should be in on monday. It is a Compaq Armarda M300 (with\
the 1024x768 screen). With the introduction of the GST,\
computer hardware suddenly dropped by about 10% (and\
software went up 10%). It is annoying that the wholesale\
prices on most hardware are about the same as US street\
prices though.
