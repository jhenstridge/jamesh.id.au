Did a lot of work on the extension class based pygtk. It\
now does most of what the non extension class based one\
did. With a simple skeleton generator, adding support for\
new libraries is very easy. I added libglade and gtkglarea\
support in just a few hours (gtkglarea was easier, as it\
required less override code). I also tightened up the type\
checking a bit, so you get a python exception if you try to\
pass a non widget to gtk\_container\_add for instance (rather\
than a Gtk-WARNING and the function failing without telling\
the python program). For those interested, you can get it\
[here](ftp://ftp.daa.com.au/pub/james/python/pygtk-0.7.0-unstable-dont-use.tar.gz).

I have been wondering about whether it is worth releasing\
this version at all, as it breaks compatibility and would be\
followed by another compatibility breaking release when\
gtk+-1.4 comes out. Even if I don\'t release it, a lot of\
the work done on it. Now that Havoc\'s gdk object branch\
has been merged into the head of gtk+, my code generator\
should be able to generate even more of the bindings.

I set up the gtk-1.3 libraries on my system, but there is\
a few problems with rendering (ie. none of the widgets\
render). I might start looking at porting pygtk accross to\
it soon.
