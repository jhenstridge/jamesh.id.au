Haven\'t posted anything here in over a month. I just\
finished my last exam today, which was good.

It was interesting hearing about the formation of the KDE\
League, especially after Kurt Granroth\'s original comments\
after then announcement of the GNOME Foundation. I did an\
[interview](http://www.linuxworld.com.au/news.php3?nid=335&tid=2)\
giving the perspective of a GNOME hacker on the League.

The Python bindings for GTK 2.0 are coming along nicely.\
I have wrappers for the new text and tree widgets mostly\
written, and they are very nice to use. Combined with\
python\'s unicode support, python makes a very nice\
environment for GTK programming.
