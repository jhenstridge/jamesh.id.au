I arrived in Prague yesterday for the [Ubuntu Developer
Summit](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-Intrepid).  Including time spent in
transit in Singapore and London, the flights took about 30 hours.

As I was flying on BA, I got to experience [Heathrow Terminal
5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Terminal_5_building). It
wasn\'t quite as bad as some of the horror stories I\'d heard.  There
were definitely aspects that weren\'t forgiving of mistakes.  For
example, when taking the train to the \"B\" section there was a sign
saying that if you accidentally got on the train when you shouldn\'t
have it would take 40 minutes to get back to the \"A\" section.

It is also quite difficult to find water fountains in the terminal,
which is inexcusable given that they don\'t let people bring their own
water bottles.

I had been a bit worried that they\'d lose my bag, but it arrived okay
in Prague.  [Jonathan](http://mumak.net/) was not so lucky.

As well as the Ubuntu and Canonical folks, there are a bunch of Gnome
developers here, including [Ryan](http://blogs.gnome.org/desrt),
[Murray](http://www.murrayc.com/blog),
[Olav](http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters), [David](http://blog.fubar.dk/)
and [Lennart](http://0pointer.de/blog).  It will be an interesting week.
