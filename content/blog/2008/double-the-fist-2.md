For anyone that cares, the new series of [Double the
Fist](http://www.abc.net.au/tv/doublethefist/) is starting tonight at
9:30pm on ABC2 (and repeated tomorrow on ABC1 for those who don\'t get
ABC2).  It has been a long time coming (4 years since the previous
series), so will hopefully be worth it.  I guess it will be available on
the internet shortly after for those outside of Australia.

It is also good to see Roy and HG covering the Olympics again, even if
it is only on the radio this time rather than television.  The shows are
being [posted on the
website](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/comedy/golden_ring/) after
airing.

I was so excited when I heard they were doing a second series, but
fairly disappointed with the first episode. I hope it gets better :)

Is any of Double the Fist free to modify and redistribute, or are they
all proprietary stuff you are advertising?
