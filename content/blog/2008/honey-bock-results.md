Since bottling the [honey bock](honey-bock.md) last month, I\'ve tried
a bottle last week and this week. While it is a very nice beer, the
honey flavour is not very noticeable. That said, the second bottle I
tried had a slightly stronger honey flavour than the first so it might
just need to mature for another month or so.

If I was to do this beer again, it would make sense to use a stronger
flavoured honey or just use more honey. Then again, perhaps it isn\'t
worth trying honey flavoured dark beers.

One beer I\'d like to make again is [Chilli
Beer](../2006/chilli-beer.md).  I
haven\'t seen any commercial equivalent to it, and it was great on a hot
summer afternoon.  Since there were chilli pieces in the bottles of the
last batch, it got hotter as it matured.  It is an interesting
experience where taking a sip of the beer cools your moth down, but it
starts heating up again once you swallow.

Wow. Chilli beer does sound great. One of my favourite beers is
[Badger](http://www.badgerdirect.com/) [Blandford
Fly](http://www.badgerdirect.com/buy/index.asp?product=1&brand=4). A
beer flavoured with ginger. The taste is so powerful it\'s difficult to
consume a whole bottle but it\'s great to share.

Well, honey can make really great imperial stouts. Check out this one:\

Amazing flavour. It is a very small bottle but I would suggest sharing
it with one or more persons.

The Sail and Anchor in Fremantle has done a chilli beer as a summer
feature on a couple of occasions before.

Check out Rogue\'s Chipotle Ale ...

Mix it with their Chocolate Stout to make \"the mole\". ;)

Rob: Sounds nice. I think the last ginger flavoured beer I had was
Speight\'s Samradh Ale from Dunedin NZ. Maybe I\'ll try and find some
Blandford Fly next time I\'m in the UK.

Sebastian: I see that that beer says it has been aged for 2.5 months. I
guess I\'ll hold off judgement on my beer for a few more months.
