I\'ve just finished the first day of the Ubuntu online services sprint
in Orlando, Florida.Â  I didn\'t repeat [last year\'s trick of falling
asleep at the airport](in-florida.md), so the trip was only about 29
hours all up.

We\'ve got a great team that I am looking forward to working with, so
it\'ll be interesting to see what we do over the next little while.

Is any of the Ubuntu \"online services\" open source or are they all
proprietary stuff you are advertising in Planet GNOME?
