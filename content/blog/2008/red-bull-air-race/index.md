Yesterday, I went to see the finals of the [Red Bull Air
Race](http://www.redbullairrace.com/) here in Perth.  This was my first
time watching the event, since I was over seas at the times it was held
the previous two years.

The weather was good, and gave me a good opportunity to play with my
camera a bit.  Sometimes you can miss out on the action by trying to
take photos, but in this case the camera made it a lot easier to see the
planes from the shore.

As the overall winner was decided by points scored over the full series,
it wasn\'t necessary for the series winner to win the Perth race.  This
turned out to be the case, with Hans Arch coming third but winning the
series.

The Perth final ended up being between two English pilots: Nigel Lamb
and Paul Bonhomme, with Bonhomme winning the race.

After the race, there was a display by the [RAAF
Roulettes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulettes) formation flying
team, and a fly over by an F/A-18 Hornet.

Overall, it was a pretty good day.  I don\'t know if I\'d have been up
for watching the entire two days worth, but the finals were
entertaining.  Hopefully I\'ll be around for next year\'s race.

Nice! I watched some of this on the internets from the comfort of my
couch here in North America. Tail cams are awesome, but I\'m sure that
being there was even more fun.
