It has been a while coming, but [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) has
[announced their move to
Bazaar](http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2008/06/19/version-control-thanks-bitkeeper-welcome-bazaar/)
for version control. This has been a long time coming, and it is
great to finally see it announced publicly.

The published Bazaar branches include 8 years of history going back to
MySQL 3.23.22, imported from the BitKeeper repositories. So you can see
a lot more than just the history since the switch: you can use all the
normal Bazaar tools to see where the code came from and how it evolved.
Giuseppe Maxia has posted [some instructions on how to check out the
code](http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/2008/06/from-bazaar-to-sandbox-in-5-moves.html)
for those who are interested.

I haven\'t checked extensively, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if this is
the largest public code base managed with Bazaar. I\'ve known from
personal experience working on Launchpad that it is capable of handling
large trees, but it is good to have a high profile project to point at
as an example now.
