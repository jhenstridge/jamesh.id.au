It is probably old news to some, but Google have put up an [information
page](http://www.google.com.au/election2007/) on the upcoming Australian
Federal Election.

The most useful tool is the [Google Maps
overlay](http://maps.google.com.au/maps/mm) that provides information
about the different electorates. At the moment it only has information
about the sitting members, their margin and links to relevant news
articles. Presumably more information will become available once the
election actually gets called.

Presumably they are planning on offering similar tools for next year\'s
US elections and this is a beta. So even if you aren\'t interested in
Australian politics, it might be worth a peak to see what is provided.
