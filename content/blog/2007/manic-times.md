When I got back from Florida, I found a copy of the [Manic
Times](http://www.manictimes.com.au/) in the mail. It seems that I
received the copy because I used to be subscribed to [The
Chaser](http://www.chaser.com.au/) back when it was a newspaper. The
newspaper is being edited by Charles Firth, who was the US correspondent
in the last series of [The Chaser\'s War on
Everything](http://www.abc.net.au/tv/chaser/war/).

The content is fairly different to what was published in The Chaser, in
that they are nominally true. That said, they are written from a
non-mainstream point of view. The issue I received seemed to focus on
the recent [APEC
conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC_Australia_2007 "APEC Australia 2007")
and related security measures (which appear to have been [fairly
poor](http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/chaser-duo-held-over-apec-stunt/2007/09/06/1188783379922.html "Chaser bust 'proves security success'")).

I haven\'t yet decided whether to subscribe, but the online subscription
form thoughtfully includes \"Governor-General\", \"Deputy
Vice-President\", \"The Right Hon\", \"Queen\" and \"Archbishop\" in the
dropdown list of titles to pick from -- something that most likely
inconveniences people on other web sites.
