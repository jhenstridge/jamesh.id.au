![](launchpad-logo.png) Today we unveiled the [Launchpad 1.0 User
Interface](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/LaunchpadRelease), which has been
in private beta for the last few months. As well as the improved visual
appearance, there are a number of new features such as the ability to
add your own branding to Launchpad pages associated with your project
(for example, [Ubuntu\'s pages](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu)).

As mentioned in the press release, we\'ve got two new high profile
projects using us for bug tracking: [The Zope 3
Project](http://wiki.zope.org/zope3) and [The Silva Content Management
System](http://www.infrae.com/products/silva). As part of their
migration, we imported all their old bug reports ([for Zope
3](https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3), and [for
Silva](https://bugs.launchpad.net/silva)). This was done using the same
import process that we used for the SchoolTool import. Getting this
process documented so that other projects can more easily switch to
Launchpad is still on my todo list.

As Launchpad is a user of Zope 3 technology, it is great being able to
provide the bug tracking infrastructure for the project. It should also
make it easier to collaborate on bugs that affect both Launchpad and
Zope.
