One of the novelties in the airport lounge at Narita was a beer pouring
machine. It manages to consistently pour a good glass of beer every
time. You start by placing the glass in the machine:

When you press the start button, it tilts the glass and pours the beer
down the side of the glass:

After filling the glass the machine tilts the glass upright again and
some extra foam comes out of the second nozzle:

Not only was the machine fun to watch, but the beer was okay too.

Hey,

in which country it has occurred? I am very curious! I never knew that
the machine could do that! Thanks for a picture.

But will it pull a decent pint of Guinness?
