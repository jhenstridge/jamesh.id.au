I am at [Narita
Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narita_International_Airport "Narita International Airport")
at the moment, on the way to Boston for some of the meetings being held
during [UDS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-Boston). It\'ll be good to
catch up with everyone again.

Hopefully this trip won\'t be as eventful as the [previous one to
Florida](in-florida.md) :)
