Last week I was in sunny Dunedin for a Launchpad/Bazaar integration
sprint with [Tim](http://how-bazaar.blogspot.com/) and
[Jonathan](http://mumak.net/). Some of the smaller issues we addressed
should make their way to users in the next Launchpad release (these were
mainly fixes to confusing error messages on bazaar.launchpad.net). Some
of the others will probably only become available a release or two
further on (mostly related to improving development workflow for
branches hosted on Launchpad).

My previous trip to New Zealand had also been to Dunedin (for last
year\'s [linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/)). Since then they\'d
replaced all the coins for denominations less than NZ\$1. Other than
being less familiar to Australians, the smaller coins seem like a good
idea. They don\'t seem to have taken Australia\'s lead in making the \$2
coin smaller than the \$1 coin though.

Thats because Australia\'s system of having the \$2 smaller than the \$1
is, retarded. I much prefer our system :-)

Is it really that bad to have the \$2 coin being smaller than the \$1
coin when the \$1 coin is smaller than the 50c coin though? :)

I guess the NZ\$2 coin just looks even more massive now that you\'ve
eliminated all the larger coins.
