Saw this interesting sculpture while cycling through East Perth:

![](http://blogs.gnome.org/jamesh/files/2006/09/triangle.jpg){width="640"
height="480"}

Of course, it can only be appreciated when standing in a particular
location
([Here](http://blogs.gnome.org/jamesh/files/2006/09/triangle-angle.jpg)
is what it looks like from another angle). I wonder how many people pass
it and don\'t realise what it is or how you are meant to look at it?

**Update:** the sculpture can be seen on [Google
Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?z=18&ll=-31.951621,115.876907&t=k&om=1)
in the centre of the round about. You can clearly see the arms of the
triangle going off in different directions.

Way cool James!

The view from the other locations shows how you\'d need a 4th dimension
to close the triangle in 3-D :-)\

Odd that they didn\'t choose the orientation so that when viewed from
the \"right\" location, there would be a less distracting background\...
(Or does it look differently when viewed by eye?)

Tor: the sculpture is in the middle of the round about seen here:

<http://maps.google.com/maps?z=18&ll=-31.951621>,115.876907&t=k&om=1

I took the photos from the park just south of the round about. While
you\'d get a nicer view if the sculpture was rotated 180Â°, you\'d only
be able to appreciate it when standing by the side of the road.

I saw that sculpture when I was in Perth last and thought nothing of it.
Now I know what it is, thanks James!

I think the original sculpture is in Escher\'s home town of Eindhoven
(Netherlands. They\'ve put it on the central reservation of a dual
carriageway and I nearly crashed my car as I drove towards it in
disbelief ;-)
