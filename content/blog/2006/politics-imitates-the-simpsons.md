Hey, I\'m actually thinking about going to Australia for my PhD. Well, I
do know the language though\... ;)

You think Australia is bad? Every ten seconds we here in the good ol\'
USA get to hear about \"them damned Mexicans\" leeching off our
bountiful economy. Of course, most fail to mention that it\'s big
business that recruits, hires, underpays and overworks the poor folks.

Then they\'re selectively picked on by our law enforcement,
discriminated against by small business owners, banks, lawyers and
neighborhood associates and used as scapegoats for the nations problems
by slick, fat, rich politicians (whose wealth was earned on the backs of
the very immigrants they deride!).

They want to build a massive fence here. Some militant groups guard the
border with guns. Neighbors and employers hold illegal immigrants
hostage, blackmailing them for their labor. It\'s disgusting.

The people of both our countries seem to have forgotten that the
majority of us came here the same way modern immigrants do now. Only the
most disenfranchised can claim to be native in any sense. Damned
immigrants indeed!
