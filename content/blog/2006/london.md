I\'ve been in London for a bit over a week now at the
[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/) sprint. We\'ve been staying in a
hotel near the Excel exhibition centre in Docklands, which has a nice
view of the docs and you can see the planes landing at the airport out
the windows of the conference rooms.

I met up with [James Bromberger](http://james.rcpt.to/) (one of the two
main organisers of [linux.conf.au 2003](http://linux.org.au/conf/2003/))
on Thursday, which is the first time I\'ve seen him since he left for
the UK after the conference.

There has been a lot of interesting stuff going on so far, some of which
is already live on the production site now. Expect to see better
integration with the bzr branch management features in the future.
