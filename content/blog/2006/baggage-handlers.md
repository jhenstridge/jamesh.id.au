One of the other guys here joked that the baggage handlers at the
airports are more likely to be careful with your luggage now.

Since there is a higher threat level, the chance of a bag exploding if a
handler mistreats it should be higher. Therefore it is in their best
interests to be careful.

\"Careful, there! Don\'t do anything too violent to that laptop bag
until after we\'ve had a chance to steal the laptop!\"
