So it seems that [Lenovo](http://www.lenovo.com/) has decided to [join
in on this battery recall fad](http://www.lenovo.com/batteryprogram). It
turns out that the main battery in my X60s is one of the explosive Sony
variety (the extended life battery isn\'t though). I rang them up to
organise the replacement, which will be arriving in 5 weeks.

Even though he hasn\'t asked for it yet, I sent the details to [Richard
Hughes](http://hughsient.livejournal.com/). It looks like the battery
model numbers are exposed through HAL, so gnome-power-manager should be
able to detect the bad batteries.

If you have an affected Thinkpad, [check your
batteries](http://www.lenovo.com/batteryprogram).

Thank you for this \"news\". I just checked and my x60s isn\'t affected
by the problem, based on the serial number of its main battery.\
I\'ll point that out to some friends around here that own a Thinkpad.
