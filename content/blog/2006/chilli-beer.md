Got around to tasting the latest batch of home-brew beer recently: a
chilli beer. It came out very nicely: very refreshing but with a chilli
aftertaste in the back of your throat. You can definitely taste the
chilli after drinking a pint `:)`.

I used a beer kit as a base, since I haven\'t yet had the patience to do
a brew from scratch. The ingredients were:

1.  A [Black Rock](http://www.blackrock.co.nz/) Mexican Lager beer kit.
2.  1kg of [Coopers](http://www.coopers.com.au) brewing sugar.
3.  About 20 red chillis.
4.  Caster sugar for carbonation.

I took half the chillis and cut off the stems and cut them up roughly
(in hind sight, it probably would have been enough to cut them
lengthwise). I then covered them with a small amount of water in a pot
and pasteurised them in the oven at 80Â°C for about half an hour. The
wort was then prepared as normal, but with the pasteurised chillis added
before the yeast.

After the fermentation was complete (about a week later), I cut up the
remaining chillis (a fair bit smaller this time -- they need to easily
fit through the neck of a bottle) and pasteurised them the same way as
the first batch. This lot was added to the bottles along with the
priming sugar.

The beer tasted pretty good 4 weeks after bottling, and it should
improve further with time.

I got into some brewing a while back, but stopped after I messed up a
couple batches (mostly documented at <http://beer.subfire.org>).

Anyway, your recipe sounds interesting\... I may have to get back into
the craft.

Yummy that sounds good. I\'ve made chilli beer before but I think
you\'ve just reminded me and encouraged me to have another go at it.

The way I\'ve done it is to just shove scored, lightly steamed whole
chillis in the bottles, but I like your approach.

Do you keep your Chilli-beers in your Chilli-bin?
