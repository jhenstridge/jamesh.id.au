The [Python](http://www.python.org/) developers have been looking for a
new bug tracker, and essentially put out a tender for people interested
in providing a bug tracker. Recently I have been working on getting
[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/)\'s entry ready, which mainly
involved working on SourceForge import.

[The entry](http://wiki.python.org/moin/LaunchpadTracker) is now up, and
our demonstration server is up and running with a snapshot of the Python
bug tracker data.

As a side effect of this, we\'ve got fairly good SourceForge tracker
import support now, which we should be able to use if other projects
want to switch away from SF.

So does this mean launchpad will be GPL\'d soon? :)

same here, how can we evaluate that which we cannot see or freely use.
Actually I wanna know if devs will be able to use it away from
launchpad.net ?

Yes ! they can switch to a closed sourced system, undermining open
source software, the exact product they are producing.

Ubuntu might be free, but its not freedom baby.\

Well, I can maybe understand that launchpad.net is not opensource nor
free and that Ubuntu use it.

Anyway I must admit that I cannot understand why a non-canonical related
project (python) would switch to a non-free BTS that they cannot control
at all !!!

In the other hand, Python on LP would absolutely rock !

So, I can see only one reason you make such announce on your blog : LP
will soon be free ! Yehaa !

and when can we easily make our own branded localized derivs of ubuntu?.
Isn\'t open source is about levelling the playing field? Isnt it a level
playing field through open source that aided ubuntu\'s sponsor raisae so
much capital?

Note that Python is currently using the SourceForge bug tracker.
SourceForge is not free software either.

As for Launchpad becoming free software, that is not my call. When code
does get released, it will probably be in components rather than the
entire thing in one go.

I agree with everyone that I would like to see Launchpad open-sourced,
but I do applaud the effort you have done to move python to launchpad. I
really do like how it works, much easier then sourceforge.
