Recently, Jeff brought up the issue of [the use of the old Gnome logo on
Slashdot](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2006-March/msg00002.html).
The reasoning being that since we decided to switch to the new logo as
our mark back in 2002, it would be nice if they used that mark to
represent stories about us.

Unfortunately this request was [shot down by Rob
Malda](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2006-March/msg00003.html),
because the logo is \"either ugly or B&W (read:Dull)\".

Not to be discouraged, I had a go at revamping the logo to meet
Slashdot\'s high standards. After all, if they were going to switch to
the new logo, they would have done so when we first asked. The result is
below:

{{< figure src="gnome-slashdot2.png" width="198" height="225" >}}

This is based on an [earlier design](gnome-slashdot.png), but I think
the drop shadow really completes the image. Iain managed to come up
with [a variant](http://www.o-hand.com/~iain/gnome-games-slashdot.png)
suitable for use on the games sub-site.

This looks ugly, look at it. Malda is blind, they should accept the
original GNOME logo.

I think you should start from the .svg file (Inkscape) and do the
drop-shadow feature there.\
As is,\
1. it\'s pixelised\
2. the shadow is badly cropped.\
3. there is some blurring.

Most importantly, there are some strong guidelines for the GNOME logo,
<http://live.gnome.org/LogoGuidelines>

Sorry if this is discouraging. I am bad with graphics as well. In any
case, there are some good artists on GNOME that can sort out such
things.

You linked the wrong file on the earlier design, I think you meant the
version without the 2 in its name.

And, please, tell me you\'re being sarcastic?

Just to re-iterate, any coloured GNOME foot will probably get shot down
by\

I agree with the anonymous guy, don\'t think this version looks good at
all. Between the drop-shadow and the colouring, it seems to be the logo
with a Slashdot skin, and really doesn\'t look good to me.

Instead, can I suggest something based on the 2.14 splash or the banner
currently on the Gnome homepage? I think the white foot on blue
background is a good look - simple and clean, without being boring.

You are right. That\'s absolutely tacky enough for slashdot. Seriously,
it goes well with the rest of the design ;-)

The foot is good, but the word probably doesn\'t need to be there
because it will be in the context of the article, and it also is very
hard to read because of the drop shadow.

Glad to see this wrong being righted!

It needs a photo of Cyborg Bill Gates getting crushed by the
foot\...also maybe something with more Google logo, then it would make
it through Slashdot\'s rigorous design process

Take a look at Slashdot topics <http://slashdot.org/topics.shtml>\
Can someone please explain me how is Sony\'s logo better than GNOME\'s
official logo (not the current Slashdot one) judging by colors (B&W) and
dullness?

Simon, at the moment the Logo Guidelines say\
\"any single color may be used.\", right at the start.

So, a simple colored logo would please Slashdot and the guidelines.\

Man, this logo really sucks. Especially the unprofessional drop-shadows.
It\'s perfect for Slashdot!
