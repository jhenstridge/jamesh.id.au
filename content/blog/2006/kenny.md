Went to see [Kenny](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0822389/) at the cinema
yesterday. A very funny movie and worth watching if you get a chance.
Given that it is a small budget Australian film though, it will probably
be hard to find overseas (similar to The Castle).

I also got round to watching my [Double the
Fist](http://www.abc.net.au/doublethefist/) volume 2 DVD which arrived
while I was in Europe. The \"Nobodies to Nobodies\" documentary included
as an extra gives a behind the scenes view of how the team was treated
during and after making the series. It is good to see that they have
finally got a chance to make [series 2](http://abc.net.au/jtv/comedy/).
