Have you wanted to play around with [bzr](http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/)
but had nowhere to share your branches? You can now publish them through
[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/). David Allouche [provides the
details](http://ddaa.net/blog/launchpad/bzr-hosting).

In short, you can upload branches to `sftp://bazaar.launchpad.net/`,
and they will be published on `http://bazaar.launchpad.net/`.
