I\'m in London at the moment with
[Carlos](http://carlos.pemas.net/blog),
[Danilo](http://danilo.segan.org/blog/),
[David](http://www.ddaa.net/blog/) and Steve for a Launchpad sprint
focused on [Bazaar](http://www.bazaar-vcs.org/) and
[Rosetta](https://launchpad.net/rosetta). The weather is a nice change
from Perth winter.

Next week I\'ll be in Vilnius, Lithuania, and then it is back to London
for another week before going home.

It is a nice change from winter weather in Perth.

Hello,\
Since you seem to be a developer of Rosetta; to where should I send an
\'official\' feature request for having an easy or even automatic way of
feeding-back the translations to mainstream projects ?

I am not a Rosetta developer, but you can submit feature requests at
<https://launchpad.net/products/rosetta/>+filebug

Improving the situation here was discussed a bit, but I don\'t know when
we\'ll have something ready to use. We will be adding more XML-RPC
interfaces to Launchpad, so it should become easier to script operations
like this.
