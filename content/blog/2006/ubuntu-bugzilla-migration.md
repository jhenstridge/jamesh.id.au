The migration is [finally going to
happen](http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2006-January/000051.html),
after much testing of migration code and improvements to
[Malone](https://launchpad.net/malone).

If all goes well, Ubuntu will be using a single bug tracker again on
Friday (as opposed to the current system where bugs in `main` go in
Bugzilla and bugs in `universe` go in Malone).
