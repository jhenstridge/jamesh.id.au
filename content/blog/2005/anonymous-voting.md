I put up a [proposal for implementing anonymous
voting](http://live.gnome.org/AnonymousVoting) for the foundation
elections on the wiki. This is based in part on [David\'s earlier
proposal](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2005-June/msg00000.html),
but simplifies some things based on the discussion on the list and
fleshes out the implementation a bit more.

It doesn\'t really add to the security of the elections process (doing
so would require a stronger form of authentication than \"can read a
particular email account\"), but does anonymise the election results and
lets us do things like tell the voter that their completed ballot was
malformed on submission.
