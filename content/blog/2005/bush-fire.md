When I woke up this morning, there was a lot of smoke in the air from
the [bush
fire](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200501/s1284725.htm) up in
the hills east of Perth. The smoke is so thick that some buildings less
than a kilometer away are only just visible. Also, sunlight filtering
through the smoke gives everything a yellow tinge.

It hasn\'t burnt down any houses yet, and hopefully the fire services
will get it under control before it does.
