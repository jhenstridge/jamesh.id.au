I\'ve been in Montreal since Wednesday for [Ubuntu Below
Zero](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBelowZero).

As well as being my first time in Canada, it was my first time in
transit through the USA. Unlike in most countries, I needed to pass
through customs and get a visa waiver even though I was in transit. The
[visa waiver
form](http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/travel/id_visa/vwp/sample_i94w.ctt/i94w_back.jpg)
had some pretty weird questions, such as whether I was involved in
persecutions associated with Nazi Germany or its allies.

I am getting up to speed with [Bazaar NG](http://www.bazaar-ng.org),
which looks like it should solve some of the scalability problems in
bazaar. The main Launchpad tree had more than 600 branches merged in,
comprising about 15,000 revisions). The equivalent `bzr` tree is
significantly smaller, and contains the full revision history for the
line of development. As well as the performance improvements, the tool
feels a lot nicer to use.
