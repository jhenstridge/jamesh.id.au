I got back from the [Launchpad](http://launchpad.net/) sprint in São
Carlos on Tuesday afternoon. It was hard work, but a lot of work got
done. Launchpad is really coming together now, and will become even
better as some of the things discussed at the sprint get implemented.

One of the things discussed was to formalise some of the development
workflow we\'ve been using to develop Launchpad inside Launchpad itself
so that it will be usable by other projects.

I really enjoyed the time in Brazil. The food and fruit juices were
great (especially the ones made from native fruits like Açaí).

At the end of the second week, Mark flew us up to Rio de Janeiro for the
weekend on his jet:

We took a cable car up [Corcovado
mountain](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=rio+de+janeiro&ll=-22.952189,-43.211964&spn=0.003435,0.004811&t=k&hl=en)
to see the [Cristo
Redentor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristo_Redentor) statue. There
was a great view from the top.

Since I was leaving that weekend, I didn\'t fly back to São Carlos with
everyone else. Instead Kiko got a local travel agent to book me a flight
directly to São Paulo, so that I could catch my international flight.

Unfortunately, when I went to the Varig ticket counter to pay for the
ticket there was no record of the booking, which was bad.

However, I was able to buy a ticket on the flight anyway (which was due
to leave in an hour), which was good. I even ended up paying less for
the ticket than I expected.

Once I got through security, I found the flight had been delayed, which
was bad. After the departure time changing about 3 times, we ended up
boarding about an hour after the original listed departure time. This
happened to coincide with the listed departure time of the next Varig
flight to São Paulo (which had the same gate listed too), causing some
confusion.

They served chocolate fondue on the flight, which was nice.

When I reached São Paulo, it turned out that my checked luggage hadn\'t,
which was bad. I filled out a lost luggage form, and the staff said
they\'d try to get my bag to the international airport in time for my
next flight if it turned up.

At the Buenos Aires and Auckland airports, I tried to find out whether
my bags had made it onto the flight. The conversations would go
something like this:

> **me:** Hi, my bag got lost on a previous flight and I want to know
> whether it made it onto my current flight. Here is the lost luggage
> form with the bag tag number.
>
> **them:** do you have a bag tag?
>
> **me:** no, they took the tag when processing the lost luggage report.
>
> **them:** well, I can\'t track the bag without the bag tag. You should
> have kept the tag.
>
> **me:** \...

It was almost the same in Sydney, except the guy at the desk took a look
at the form and realised that it had a bag tag number on it (the thing
they wanted the bag tag for), and found that the bag had been put on my
flight. Sure enough, it turned up on the carousel.

The rest of the trip was fairly uneventful, which was nice.

You went back to New Zealand through Buenos Aires?, which Airline?

Aerolineas Argentinas. Unsurprisingly, they use the capital of Argentina
as a hub.
