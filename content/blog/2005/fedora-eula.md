[roozbeh](http://www.advogato.org/person/roozbeh/diary.html?start=8):
the [Fedora
EULA](http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/development/i386/eula.txt)
probably isn\'t a GPL violation (I\'m sure Red Hat has legal advice that
it is okay). Section 1 says *\"This agreement does not limit User\'s
rights under, or grant User rights that supersede, the license terms of
any particular component\"*. So the EULA explicitly says that it
doesn\'t limit any rights you received under the GPL. Section 2 goes on
to say that your rights to copy or modify individual components of the
distro are covered by the respective license.

What the EULA does cover is the particular compilation of the individual
components making up the distribution. This is similar to the way a book
publisher can claim copyright on a particular selection/ordering of
poems that are in the public domain --- while you can copy the
individual poems, it would be a violation to copy the anthology as a
whole.

The export controls section is just a restatement of the U.S. export
regulations for cryptography, so wouldn\'t affect the non cryptographic
portions. I\'m not sure how this section would interact with the first
section in the case of GPL\'d/LGPL\'d cryptography software though.
