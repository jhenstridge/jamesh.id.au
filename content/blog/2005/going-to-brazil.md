On Sunday I will be going to be travelling to SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil for two
weeks of the [Launchpad](https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/) sprint. It will
be my first time travelling to either Brazil or South America so should
be fun. That leaves just North America as the only major continent I
haven\'t visited.

I\'m a little disappointed, I was expecting a \"going to brazil\"
tutorial, how to get there, why, see also, these sort of things. Thank
you anyway

Have fun in Brazil! I\'m going there in four weeks just for vacation.
I\'ll be going to ForteLeza and Natal. The Brazilian ministry of
Information Technology has been seriously looking at Linux-based
refurbished computers to supply schools and individuals in poor areas
with some inexpensive technology. I would really love to get involved
with that project. Ask around while your there please!
