**Eugenia\'s Article**

I find it amusing how Eugenia selectively quotes mailing list posts to
create an article about how Gnome doesn\'t care about what users want,
and then in a follow-up asks that people don\'t take her article out of
context.

**New Gettext**

While looking at the new version of gettext, I noticed the libgettextpo
library. Starting with the new 0.14.2 release, this library now includes
a `.po` file writer as well as a parser. I wonder if this could be
useful for tools like `intltool`.

One of the other things I noticed in the new release was at the end of
the `NEWS` file entry for the release:

> **Tim Tams**
