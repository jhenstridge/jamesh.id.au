If you look at the bottom of [Cadbury\'s
website](http://www.cadbury.com.au/) in the footer of the page, you find
the following text:

> \..., and the colour purple are Cadbury Group trade marks in
> Australia.

Apparently Cadbury believes they can trade mark a colour, and according
to a story on [the radio](http://abc.net.au/triplej/hack/) they\'ve been
sending out cease and desist letters to other small chocolate makers in
Australia.

It turns out that even though they are claiming it as a trade mark, they
only have a pending application. The details can be found by going to
[here](http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/falcon.application_start),
choose \"enter as guest\", and enter \"902086\" into the search box at
the bottom (it doesn\'t seem like you can bookmark a particular
application).

It seems that the application has been pending since February 2002, and
was deferred at the applicant\'s request 5 months later. So it seems
weird that they\'ve started trying to assert it now. The 17 categories
the application mentions include soaps and perfumes, jewellery, kitchen
utensils, clothing and leathergoods (it also includes classes that
you\'d expect a chocolate company to claim).

It seems like a clear abuse of the trade mark system, and I\'m surprised
it isn\'t getting more news coverage.
