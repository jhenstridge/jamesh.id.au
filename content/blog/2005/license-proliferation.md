[Glynn](http://www.gnome.org/~gman/blog/13102005): you say that the CDDL
is just an attempt to stop the proliferation of software licenses, yet
the end result appears to be yet another license.

I realise that many of the [changes in the
CDDL](http://www.sun.com/cddl/CDDL_why_details.html) with respect to the
[MPL](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html) make sense (e.g. not
fixing choice of legal jurisdiction into the license), but it is still
another license for people to digest.

Of course, this complaint would be invalidated if many of the projects
using the MPL or one of its variants switched to the CDDL instead. Has
Sun approached anyone about doing so? (e.g.
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/),
[Cairo](http://www.cairographics.org/), etc).

**update:** I guess it is
[possible](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.licenses.open-source.proliferation/4)
that such a license merger is under discussion.
