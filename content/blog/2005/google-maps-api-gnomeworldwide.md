title: 'Google Maps API + GnomeWorldWide?'

I was looking at the [Google Maps API](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/)
documentation, and had an idea: combine it with the data from
[GnomeWorldWide](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWorldWide), and you could
have a nice zoomable map, and provide extra info when clicking on the
marker (name, location, hackergotchi, etc).

I might take a look at this when I get some time (probably after getting
back from [Brazil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/)).

Let me know if you want some help with this. I think it would be
super-cool. I\'ve played with the Google Maps API, but I want to do
something a little more complex.

You mean something like Ross Burton did:

Great movie, Brazil. Have you read the book it\'s based on?

Dennis: yeah. Ross did that after we talked about it on IRC. There is a
lot more that could be done though, such as popping up some user info
when clicking on the markers.
