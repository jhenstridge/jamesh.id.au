I went to see End of Fashion upstairs at [78s](http://www.78records.com.au)
today for their in-store appearance. The tickets were included with the
band\'s single which was pretty nice.

They played for about 40 minutes, starting off with some of their well
known songs, and then mixed in a few of the new ones off the album.
Towards the end, they did a cover of The Red Sun Band\'s \"Devil Song\".

After the set the band were doing autographs, so I got the liner notes
from my copy of the new album signed by all the band members. I like
what I\'ve listened to on the album so far.
