The excellent show [Double the
Fist](http://www.abc.net.au/doublethefist/) is being rerun on
[ABC](http://www.abc.net.au/tv/) on Thursday nights at 11:15pm.

Even though the show won an AFI award last year, it was pretty easy to
miss because it was initially shown on ABC 2 (the digital-only channel,
which only a fraction of the population can tune into) and then late at
night on the main channel.

I\'ve been wanting to see the rest of the series ever since catching it
part way through when it was shown last.

I had never seen this show before stumbling across it last night -
myself and my son were rolling on the floor in stiches. according to the
website next weeks episode is a filler rather than the planned episode.

Mephisto Knows \...

Fraction of the population? Geezus, they transmit it everywhere, and the
decoders are like \$80 now from the supermarket. Everyone was whinging
for years \"oooh, my reception is bad \-- oooh, I can\'t see ABC because
of the snow\" so what do they do, FIX IT, and now everybody\'s crying
\"oooh I have to buy a decoder!!\" WELL SHUT UP and STOP WATCHING IT if
you can\'t be bothered. If it\'s any incentive, the HD decoders get you
the ABC without the bloody watermark.

Decoders are for the WEAK, and nobody actually buys them.. but this is
the greatest show ever, they should give it more funding and move it to
prime time, it seems like noone has even heard of it.. it is a sad world

I agree decoders are weak. If you don\'t live in an area where you can
watch TV then you probably married your cousin and your children have
more than 10 shows. Steve sets the benchmark for what real men should
be. Unlike most snivelling, metro, softcore, fairy floss eating, whining
dogs who buy decoders.

There should be a law so that all school children are forced to watch
this at school.
