Found out about [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).
While you don\'t need to use [Python](http://www.python.org/) to solve
most of the problems, a knowledge of the language certainly helps. While
the initial problems are fairly easy, some of the later ones are quite
difficult, and cover many topics.

If you decide to have a go, here are a few hints that might help:

-   Keep a log of what you do. Solutions to may provide insight into
    subsequent problems.
-   Look at ALL the information provided to you. If the solution isn\'t
    apparent, look for patterns in the information and extrapolate.
-   If you are using brute force to solve a problem, there is probably a
    quicker and simpler method to get the answer.
-   If you get stuck, check [the
    forum](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=1) for
    hints.

There is also a [solutions wiki](http://wiki.pythonchallenge.com/),
however, you need to have solved the corresponding problem before it
will give you access.
