**Gnome Developer Websites**

I converted the Gnome LXR and Bonsai installations over to the new site\
design Jeff did.  Overall it looks very good.  Having a\
consistent design across the sites makes them all look a lot more\
professional.  This just leaves the big one to do (www.gnome.org).\

[raph](http://www.advogato.org/person/raph/) committed my patch to add
\<link\> elements to the items in\
the diary RSS feeds.  This should make the RSS feeds a bit more\
useful, since you can then go from the RSS to the individual diary\
entries.\
\
I also had a play with the [Mozilla
midas](http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midas-spec.html) rich text editing
functionality as a way to provide [WYSIWIG diary
entry](http://www.daa.com.au/%7Ejames/files/advogato-diary.html). \
It is a little rough, but it is good enough to write this diary entry\
with :)  With a small amount of hacking, I was able to get the\
code to work with IE as well.\

It seems that our Prime Minister and Attorney-General seem to have\
decided that it is okay to have an Australian citizen tried without due\
process in a secret court where he could face execution.  If there\
is evidence against him, there shouldn\'t be any problem trying him in\
an Australian court.  It is particularly sickenning to see them\
acting like this when compared to the British government\'s actions
with\
respect to their citizens in a similar situation.  There was an\
interesting [article by Malcolm
Fraser](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/13/1058034877654.html)
about this yesterday.
