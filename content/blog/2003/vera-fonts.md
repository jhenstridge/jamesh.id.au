[freetype](http://www.advogato.org/person/freetype/): I have a \"beta\"
version of the Vera fonts, and they are in TrueType format. I think it
is safe to assume the final version will also be in TrueType format.

The Vera fonts are based on the
[Prima](http://store.bitstream.com/searchresults.asp?searchtext=Prima)
fonts if you want to see more samples. The copies I have display quite
nicely with recent freetype versions (using the autohinter). The slides
for my presentation at [linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/) were
displayed with the Vera fonts. They didn\'t look as good as they might
have because MagicPoint still uses freetype1 :(

The fonts should be available to the general public in about a month (or
maybe a bit less). Jim has done a great job with this.
