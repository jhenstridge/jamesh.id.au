Put out a new release of fontilus, which increased the number of
supported languages from 2 (including the default english) to 21. It
also has a few small UI improvements for the font view dialog, and adds
a context menu item for fonts in the \"`fonts:`\" folder that allows you
to easily set the default application font for Gnome.

You can also now use fontilus to view the [Bitstream Vera
fonts](http://www.gnome.org/fonts/). The fonts are currently available
in a limited beta form (you can download and use the fonts, but not
redistribute them). The terms that will be used for the finished version
of the fonts is also available at the above site, which probably meets
the open source definition (some people think it doesn\'t, but the
license seems to satisfy all the points in the definition).
