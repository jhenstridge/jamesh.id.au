There was a really weird interview on Lateline last friday. They now
have [the
transcript](http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s940429.htm).
Christopher Pyne really reminded me of [Dexter
Pinion](http://www.abc.net.au/backberner/credits.htm#dexter) from
Backberner.

Looks like the government put up [a
website](http://www.shakenbaby.communitydevelopment.wa.gov.au/) for one
of the weirdest community service announcement I\'ve seen in a while. I
wonder if they intended to make it as funny as it seemed?
