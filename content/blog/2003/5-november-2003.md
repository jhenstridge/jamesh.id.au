[**Mark**](http://www.advogato.org/person/sisob/diary.html?start=84):
the support for building the [freedesktop.org X
server](http://xserver.freedesktop.org/) hasn\'t been there for a while.
It was just added yesterday by Johan Dahlin.

If anyone else is interested in building some of the stuff in
freedesktop.org CVS using jhbuild, I wrote some instructions and put
them [in the wiki](http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/jhbuild).
