**linux.conf.au**

Spent the day packing bags for the Linux conference. Stuffing cruft into
350 bags is more work than you would at first think \... Good thing that
there was a lot of people to help.

Alan and Telsa got in today, and got tricked into helping out with the
bag stuffing.

I also put together an [iCalendar](http://linux.conf.au/lca2003.ics)
file containing all the talks in the program that people can merge into
their calendars. I don\'t think I have seen other conferences do this,
so I don\'t know how many people will use it. Was a bit fiddly to set up
with Evolution, and even more so when I realised I had my Evo timezone
set wrong `:(`.

**Hacking**

My **fontilus** nautilus extension was in the new Red Hat beta (as well
as being in Debian and Mandrake). It even got a mention in the
[ExtremeTech review of the RH
beta](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,803562,00.asp). The
newest release will turn on thumbnailing by default (if you have a new
enough libgnomeui and nautilus), so it looks a bit better than the
screenshots in that article. I also put out the first tarball release of
**nautilus-rpm**, which currently only views info in the RPM database
rather than modifying things. Still a lot to do to make it really
useful.
