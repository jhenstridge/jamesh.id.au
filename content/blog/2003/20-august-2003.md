**Python**

Spent a bit of time writing [a
reply](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-August/037744.html)
to [kiko](http://www.advogato.org/person/kiko/)\'s proto-PEP about
fixing Python\'s handling of `LC_NUMERIC`.

As it stands at the moment, Python requires `LC_NUMERIC` to be set to
`C` in order to function correctly (important things like parsing of
floats in source code break if it is set to a locale that uses a comma
as the decimal point). They then have some hacks that allow you to parse
and format floats according to locale conventions. This all works great
in a pure Python environment.

However if you have another library that want to display or parse floats
in a locale sensitive fashion and want to use it with Python, things
start to break down. If the library isn\'t Python specific, it is
unlikely to change (after all, it is just using standard C library
functions according to the specification). One such library that falls
into this category is [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org), which is where
[kiko](http://www.advogato.org/person/kiko/) first ran into the problem.

I think most of the Python developers realise that the current code is a
problem now, which is good because it is the first step to getting it
fixed.

**Mail Viruses**

Like most people, I woke up today with about 50 or so bounce messages in
my inbox. I have a set of `header_checks` rules in my postfix
configuration that reject windows executable attachments, so I never
actually received a copy of the actual worm, but I received many many
rejection messages from other servers, since the Sobig.F worm forges the
`From:` address.

I quickly modified the mail filters to discard rather than reject
Sobig.F messages, to make sure we aren\'t adding to the problem.

I am surprised that none of the major server side anti-virus products
correctly discard these virus messages with forged senders. They all
seem to identify the type of virus, so they should be able to control
what action is performed based on the virus type (for mail viruses that
don\'t forge the sender, rejection still seems like the best option).
