[edd](http://www.advogato.org/person/edd/): The advogato RSS export has
been around for quite a while; however
[raph](http://www.advogato.org/person/raph/) only recently added the
little RSS buttons.. I recently submitted a patch to add the missing
\<link\> elements, which it looks like I screwed up slightly `:)`.

Before it was only giving the pubDate and description elements. I have
submitted another patch to add a title elements and fix the links.
Don\'t know when it will be applied though.

**Update:** Raph applied the patch. Now advogato diary entries are
showing up on [Jeff\'s Gnome Hackers
aggregator](http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/planetgnome/). Thanks!
