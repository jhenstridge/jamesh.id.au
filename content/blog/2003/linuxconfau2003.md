The mini-conferences started today, and have been going pretty well.
More of the speakers have arrived, and there will be even more tomorrow.

Had take-away chinese down by the river for dinner tonight.
[jdub](http://www.advogato.org/person/jdub/) was lecturing the seagulls
with a pair of chopsticks. They weren\'t listenning.

Probably the biggest news that has broken recently is that [we got
Linus](http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,5860210%255E15306,00.html).
We managed to sell all tickets to the conference without this
information leaking, so I am pleased with how popular it is so far.

Probably the best place to keep up with the media coverage is at
[news.google.com](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&q=linux.conf.au).
