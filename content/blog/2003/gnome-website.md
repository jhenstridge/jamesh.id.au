Jeff moved the main Gnome website over to the new design yesterday.
While there is still a fair bit to do on the content side, it does look
a lot nicer. He also got rid of the [WML](http://thewml.org/) dependency
which was a large barrier to potential contributors.

Once the new infrastructure gets merged, it\'ll be possible to mark up
new content as plain XHTML or Docbook/XML and have it all fit into the
site design. This will make it a lot easier to contribute, since there
are more tools available to edit those formats, and it is possible to
easily validate them.

A story got posted to Footnotes about the update while it was in
progress, which resulted in a fair number of troll comments. Makes me
glad I didn\'t end up switching the main site over `:)`.
