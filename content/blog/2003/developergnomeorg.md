Got a bit tired of the ancient site design of the Gnome developer
website, so spent a little while updating it to match
[jdub](http://www.advogato.org/person/jdub/)\'s new site design. Now all
that is left to do is to fix the content `:)`

**Update:** updated the [bugzilla.gnome.org](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/)
templates to match.
