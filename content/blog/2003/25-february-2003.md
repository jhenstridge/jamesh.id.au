**website**

After not having touched my website for a long time (years), I finally
decided to do a bit of work on it. Wrote some scripts to automatically
generate the navigation links (and added \<link\> elements). Decided to
put the slides for talks I have given up in one place. Still a fair bit
more information worth putting up for the packages I maintain though.

**linux.conf.au:2003**

The conference CD should be finalised tomorrow (thanks to a lot of work
done by Tony). We\'ve got material from just about all the speakers,
audio of all the talks (in [Speex](http://www.speex.org) format) and
some photos, so it should be quite good. The CD will be mailed out to
delegates, and ISOs will be made available when they are ready.

**Ring John Howard at Home**

[The Chaser](http://www.chaser.com.au) stirred up a bit of trouble at
the end of last week with the headline on the front page of their
satirical newspaper: [Howard Ignores the People. So call him at home on
(02) 9922 6189](http://www.chaser.com.au/frontpages/big0068_p1.jpg).
According to [a
story](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/22/1045638540826.html) in
the Sydney Morning Herald, his home phone was ringing non stop until
they changed the number.
