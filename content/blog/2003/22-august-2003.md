**[raph](http://www.advogato.org/person/raph/)**: If you upgrade to
[Mailman 2.1](http://www.list.org/), you can run `qrunner` as a daemon
instead of from Cron (this is in fact the preferred way to run it).

This does have some disadvantages, of course. I have experienced
problems with 2.1.x `qrunner` running away and using all the CPU on
occasions (a problem with temporary failures for local delivery being
handled by queuing the message for immediate re-delivery). I found that
the particular problem I ran into had been fixed on the `HEAD` branch
though, which I am now running on my mail server. It should handle the
higher loads though.

If you want to remove some of the intermediate steps you can use my [to
get mailman to call spamassassin
directly](http://www.daa.com.au/~james/articles/mailman-spamassassin/).
This means that list traffic will only go through MTA, Mailman and
Spamassassin. It will also allow mailman to do some moderation decisions
based on message scores (ie. discard messages above a particular score
without moderation).
