**SpamAssassin/Mailman**

I recently upgraded the [Mailman](http://www.list.org/) installation on
the machine handling the
[pygtk](http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/pygtk/) mailing lists. I
am now using Mailman 2.1.1, and so far it looks a lot nicer.

I took the opportunity to update my
[SpamAssassin](http://www.spamassassin.org/) patches for the new Mailman
(the old filter didn\'t work anymore). I now have the code for talking
to spamd split into a separate module, which might be useful for other
projects, and means that it can be updated for newer SpamAssassin
versions as needed without changing the MM related code.

I now have the filter using the list name as the user passed to spamd.
Together with the virtual user dir mode in spamd, I now have SA
maintaining separate auto-whitelists and bayes databases for each list,
which should help improve the filtering.

What would be nice to do next would be to get the Mailman moderation
page hooked up to SA, so that it can feed the decisions made during
moderation back to the bayes database. Will need to think a bit about
how best to implement this though.

**Peace March**

The next peace march in Perth is being held on Saturday (March 22nd) at
noon. Will be interesting to see if more or less people will come to
this one compared to the previous march.
