**PyGTK**

[A
story](http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1316&mode=nested&order=0&thold=0)
was posted on FootNotes about the 2.0 release. A number of nice
comments. The 2.0.0 package has hit Mandrake cooker, and a Fink package
is apparently in the works.

I\'ve started work on adding support for the GTK 2.2 APIs, which
shouldn\'t take very long at all. I\'ve updated the `.defs` files, which
covers most of the APIs. There are some others that will require a
little more work.

PyGTK 2.2 will be a drop in replacement for 2.0.0 when it is ready, just
as GTK 2.2 is.

**Mail Viruses**

Only [5 days](http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/sobig_f.shtml) til I stop
receiving bounces from the sobig worm! I had hoped that people would fix
their mail servers, to not send out these erroneous bounces, but no such
luck `:(`

I wonder when the next one will strike?

**TV**

The new series of [CNNNN](http://www.cnnnn.com/) started a couple of
weeks ago. Been pretty good so far. I don\'t think it is the kind of
show that they could syndicate overseas though `:)`
