-   finished my exams at the end of last week. Hopefully I\
    should have more time to work on the packages I maintain.
-   close to getting a new release of libglade ready. It is\
    mostly a bug fix release.
-   hopefully I should be able to get gnome-vnc and gnorpm\
    up to scratch. Gnorpm has heaps of bug reports open, but\
    the majority are for about three packages. It would be nice\
    if the web bug submission form got people to look at the\
    current bugs for a package. If their bug is covered, then\
    they could add information. This would save me having to\
    merge the reports. Of course, I will have to fix those bugs\
    :)
