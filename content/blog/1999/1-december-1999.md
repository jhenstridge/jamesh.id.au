Alexander Larsson handed over the job of maintainer of\
dia to me. He has done a great job so far, but did not have\
enough time to put into maintaining it. I have a few ideas\
for new features I want to work on. These include the\
scripting interface, object properties and printing\
changes.

If anyone wants to help out with dia, join the dia\
mailing list.
