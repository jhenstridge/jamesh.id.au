I made my first release of dia as its new maintainer. It\
mostly seemed to go well. There are a few bugs that showed\
up after the release, so I will have to fix those. I guess\
we can get back to breaking things to add new features.

Did not end up going diving on monday night, since it\
felt like more work getting everything ready than we wanted\
to do.

I commited the new GnomePaperSelector widget and\
GnomeUnitSpinner widget to gnome-libs HEAD branch. As well\
as looking nicer, it should be easier to use for people\
using something other than points as the paper units.

Doing a bit more work on the glibwww based rpmfind code\
in gnorpm. I think I am getting close to having the find\
directory compiling correctly. Then I will have to check if\
all my logic is correct and convert the rest of gnorpm\
(which would be easier).
