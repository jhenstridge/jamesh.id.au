**[EggMenu](http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libegg/libegg/menu/)**

The menu merge code is mostly working now. With some
help from Anders, almost all the menu merge functionality is
working. You can merge and demerge UI files, bind a
particular menu item to a different action, and use
placeholders.

Toolbars are still left to go. I need to work out how to
do the placeholders on toolbars, as the placeholder
implementation for menus makes use of (possibly hidden)
separator menu items before and after the elements within
the placeholder. The separators in GtkToolbar are not
widgets, so I will need to work out some other way to handle it.

Preparation for the conference is going well. We are
still waiting for more submissions for the Call for Papers.
If you want to do a talk, please send in a submission!
