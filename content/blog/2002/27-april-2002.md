Updated my [Mailman](http://www.list.org)\
patch to use some of the newer features in [SpamAssassin
2.20](http://spamassassin.taint.org).\
This includes showing which rules got triggered for\
messages that get held (this is the feature that required\
the 2.20), and the ability to give messages from list\
members a bonus when calculating the message score (so that\
they are less likely to get held/discarded). The newer\
version is in Mailman\'s patch tracker:

> <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=534577&group_id=103&atid=300103>

With this patch and SA 2.20, I seem to be getting about\
80% less messages to moderate, which is much more\
manageable. Adjusting the thresholds a little would\
probably improve matters further.

[jdub](http://www.advogato.org/person/jdub/) put the original version of
my\
patch on [mail.gnome.org](http://mail.gnome.org)\
(with a discard threshold of 20 \-- mainly to test its\
ability to identify spam). It manages to get rid of the\
worst of the spam delivered to [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) lists
though.

With this patch, you could almost open a list up to non\
subscriber posting again, like most list admins did before\
the spam epidemic grew to its current proportions. The SA\
mailman filter doesn\'t catch everything though, so list\
members would have to be slightly tolerant of spam to allow\
non subscriber posting again.
