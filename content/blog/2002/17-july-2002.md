One of the annoying problems with
[libtool](http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) is the way the
`-export-symbols` and `-export-symbols-regex`. The flags are supposed to
limit which symbols in the library are available to programs that
dynamically link to the library.

Unfortunately, the feature is not implemented correctly for many
platforms. Rather than leaving symbols out of the dynamic symbol table,
it just removes debugging information for the non-exported symbols (so
not only does it not work, it also makes your code harder to debug
\...).

So I put together a simple patch to fix the problem. At the moment, it
only changes the behaviour under Linux as I can\'t verify whether it
works correctly in the other cases (it probably does though). If anyone
wants to try the patch, it is available at:

I wonder if libtool will make a new release any time soon?
