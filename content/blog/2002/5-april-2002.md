Looks like [jdub](http://www.advogato.org/person/jdub/) is pushing to
get my mailman\
patches put up on [mail.gnome.org](http://mail.gnome.org/).\
It will be interesting to see how they hold up under heavy\
volume. It\
is coded fairly defensively, so it shouldn\'t cause mail lossage\
(unless you configure it to lose certain bits of mail), but\
I have no\
idea whether it has an acceptable CPU overhead.

Saw [Rabit Proof Fence](http://www.imdb.com/Title?0252444) on Saturday.
A very\
good\
movie and worth watching. It makes me sad to see how\
Aborigines have\
been treated.

**Going to GUADEC**

This is the first time I have travelled internationally since\
September 11th and the terrorist paranoia. All the parking\
spots\
immediately outside the terminal were blocked off (apparently to\
prevent terrorists from leaving bombs \-- like any terrorist\
organisation would want to bomb Perth Airport).

When going through xray machines at customs, the ladie in\
front of\
me got held up for having a nail file in her hand luggage. They\
stopped me because I had a laptop. They asked me to take\
the laptop\
out of the bag, disconnect the battery and then pass them\
all through\
the xray machine separately.

When we got the meals on the plane, they came with metal\
spoon,\
metal fork and plastic knife. The forks are probably\
sharper than the\
metal knives they usually provide with meals.

Travelling by plane sure is a lot less convenient now.

**Sevilla**

After getting my luggage checked through customs, I found\
a bus\
outside the airport going into the city. Caught it and got\
off some\
place that turned out to be two or three kilometers from the\
house\
[docpi](http://www.advogato.org/person/docpi/) organised. I walked the
rest of the\
way to the\
house.

I eventually found the place, and it had 4 buzzers (one\
for each\
appartment). On the forth try, I got let in (first two were\
empty,\
and the docpi was in the last one). The appartment looked\
great \--\
marble floors, balconies looking out in two directions, etc.

**April 2**

In the supermarket, they had really big 6 packs \-- 6 one\
litre\
bottles plastic wrapped together. Meandered around the city\
for the day, and had a very nice meal at night.

**\...**

Will have to write something about the actual conference.\
So far it has been a lot of fun.
