Put out new releases of pygtk and gnome-python for GTK 1.2 and 2.0. The
new releases support parallel install in the same installation of
Python. The new pygtk-1.99.13 release also includes the patches
necessary to build out of the box on windows.

Also updated the [generated pygtk
documentation](http://www.gnome.org/~james/pygtk-docs/). This version
includes the documentation for Boxed and Pointer types, adds a class
synopsis at the start of each section, and a full class heirachy at the
beginning. Hopefully they will be a bit more useful for people now. I
also customised the xml to html stylesheets to generate a `.devhelp`
file, which means that I can browse the documentation in
[DevHelp](http://devhelp.net/).
