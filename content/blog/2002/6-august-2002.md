On Sunday, the white of my right eye was almost completely red, which
was a bit of a shock. I went to the doctor on Monday, who didn\'t know
what the problem was exactly, so prescribed some prednisolone eye drops.
They seem to be working okay, and the red has retreated to just one side
of the pupil, and will hopefully be gone in a day or too, which is a
relief.
