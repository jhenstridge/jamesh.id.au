Started another batch of beer yesterday. This time I\
mixed in a kilogram of honey (replacing some of the sugar),\
so it will be interesting to see how this turns out. The\
bubbles coming out of the airlock smell fairly different, so\
it will hopefully go okay.

Merged some patches from various people into my jhbuild\
build scripts over the weekend. Thanks to jdahlin, it now\
has support for getting things from other CVS trees. At the\
moment, we have rules for thinice2, gstreamer and mrproject\
using this feature.
