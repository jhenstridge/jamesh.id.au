**[linux.conf.au\
2003](http://conf.linux.org.au/)**

The Call for Papers is out:

> <http://conf.linux.org.au/pipermail/lca-helpers/2002-May/000109.html>

There is also an HTML version on the website, but it\
doesn\'t quite match the final version of the CFP (yet).

**Beer**

Bottled the honey ale today. It will be interesting to\
see how it tastes in a few weeks. The sweetness was gone,\
but I could definitely taste the honey still. It should be\
very nice.

**GNOME 2.0**

Put out yet another beta of libglade for the GNOME 2.0\
beta 5 release which should be comming out this week. I\
should also make new releases of pygtk and gnome-python as\
well. I have done a number of improvements to the code\
generator, so pygtk is a bit more complete. The last\
gnome-python release no longer compiles with the latest\
GConf, so it also needs a new release.
