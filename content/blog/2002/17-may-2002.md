Switched over to GNOME 2.0 on my laptop. It is\
definitely at the stage where I can use it for every day\
work. There are a few annoyances, but it is shaping up\
quite nicely. Libglade is shaping up very nicely, and will\
probably be go stable soon. PyGTK might take a little longer.

I recently found out that
[bugzilla.gnome.org](http://bugzilla.gnome.org) has\
support for new email tech, but it was turned off by\
default. I turned it on, and the bug mail looks a lot nicer\
(like my mail from all the other bugzillas, rather than diff\
-u output).
