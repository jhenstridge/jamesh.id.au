**Jury Duty (almost)**

**Thursday, 17 October**

I received a letter, dated 16 October, saying that I have jury duty in
5 days (Tuesday). Rather than being held at the closer Perth District
Court, it is to be held out at Fremantle `:(` The Weird thing is that
it says that I should notify them at least 5 days before hand if I
should be excluded.

I spent the weekend wondering about what it will be like, and
wondering why it was scheduled at such short notice.

**Monday, 21 October**

I received an overnight envelope saying that the Court case out at
Fremantle has been rescheduled to be held in the Perth Court, so I am
no longer required. This letter was dated *17 October*.

I am a bit pissed off about this. I don\'t mind getting called for jury
duty, but I would expect slightly more notice. If it was going to be
cancelled, I would also prefer to hear about it earlier than the night
before hand.
