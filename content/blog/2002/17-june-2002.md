**Work**

Last week, one of the servers died because one of the sticks of memory
died. After pulling it out, the system booted fine. It would have been
a lot easier to test if I didn\'t have to open it up to plug a floppy
drive in. I now have [Memtest86](http://www.memtest86.com/) in the
[GRUB](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) boot menu. Was pretty easy
to set up:

    cp memtest.bin /boot grubby --add-kernel="/boot/memtest.bin" --title="Memtest86"

This is the second stick of DDR memory we have had that died; probably
due to overheating. As the server has 5 IDE ribbon cables, I might
look at getting rounded cables which
[Jaycar](http://www.jaycar.com.au) is stocking these days.

**GNOME**

The release candidate for GNOME is out. It is looking very nice, and
will be a great release. Still working towards a 2.0 release of
[PyGTK](/software/pygtk/index.md) and gnome-python. I did a bit of
work on gnome-vfs bindings (there are a number of annoying
inconsistencies in the API, but overall it is a nice library), and
[jrb](http://www.advogato.org/person/jrb/) has been trying to
implement a full widget in python (and reporting bugs for things that
prevent him from doing so).

**Beer**

The honey ale I brewed turned out very nice. The first bottle I tried
(two weeks after bottling) was a bit sour, but subsequent bottles have
improved a lot.
