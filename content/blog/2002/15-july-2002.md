[sej](http://www.advogato.org/person/sej/): that sounds a lot more like
the [NPL](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/NPL-1.1.html) than the
[MPL](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html). The MPL does not give
any special privileges to Netscape, the only mention of Netscape in the
license is that they may publish new versions of the licence, similar to
GPL.

In fact, the [license
policy](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html) states that new
original code should be licenced under MPL/GPL/LGPL tripple license. I
am not quite sure why an LGPL rendering library (such as the LGPL
portions of [raph](http://www.advogato.org/person/raph/)\'s
[libart](http://www.advogato.org/proj/libart/)) should be a problem \--
such a license sounds consistant with the license policy for \"new
non-original source files\".
