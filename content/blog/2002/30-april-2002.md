**Menu Code**

I moved all my action based menu prototype code into
[libegg](http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/libegg/),\
which is becomming the prototype library
[hp](http://www.advogato.org/person/hp/)\
proposed a while back.
[andersca](http://www.advogato.org/person/andersca/) might\
check in some of his new icon list widget soon, which will\
be good. GTK+ 2.4 should be very good (the 2.2 feature list\
has already been finalised; it is basically 2.0 plus the\
multihead patches, and should be available in a month or two).

My menu code should eventually provide menu merge\
capabilities similar to the UI handler code in libbonoboui,\
but not depending on any of the corba stuff. It should be\
extensible enough so that it can be used by things like\
bonobo. The aim being to allow gtk+ and gnome/bonobo\
programs to use exactly the same menu code (rather than\
having to rewrite portions of an app in order to port it to\
GNOME).

**[linux.conf.au](http://conf.linux.org.au/)**

Hopefully the Call for Papers should be released in a day\
or two. Just a few last details to finalise. Note that the\
conference website is at `conf.linux.org.au` at the\
moment, due to the transient nature of `.conf.au`\
domains. I hope to see everyone in Perth next January!

**PyGTK**

The Python bindings for GTK+ 2.0 are going pretty well.\
The defs files are pretty much up to date with the 2.0 API,\
so I have a fair idea of what needs to be done. After\
finishing up a few of the remaining architectural issues, it\
would be good to put out a 2.0 release. Not everything\
needs to be wrapped, but I should reduce the number of\
unwrapped functions.
