From what has been happening, it sounds like Air New\
Zealand had been siphoning money out of
[Ansett](http://www.ansett.com.au/) by charging fuel\
and catering costs against the airline and possibly doing so\
after it knew Ansett was bankrupt. This has caused Ansett\
workers to call for a boycott of Air NZ, which the NZ PM [doesn\'t\
like
much](http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/2001/09/17/FFXDJ5BQNRC.html).

To save money, the `.au` Government allowed the\
two domestic airlines (Qantas/Australian Airlines and\
Ansett) to build the air terminals themselves. At almost\
every domestic airport in australia, you will see a Qantas\
half and an Ansett half (usually with different\
architecture, etc). Separate checkins, separate bagage\
collection, separate arival/departure gates, etc. Now half\
of every domestic air terminal is left closed. Those people\
who happened to own shops inside an Ansett terminal can\'t\
open for business. I really hope some of the smaller\
airlines (such as Virgin) will finally be allowed to use\
Ansett\'s space in the domestic terminals, which will allow\
them to compete more evenly than before (before they often\
had to use other buildings round the airport or the\
international airport terminals).

The ACCC is going to [toughen\
the
rules](http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/2001/09/17/FFX92L5QNRC.html)
for airlines so that this change doesn\'t make\
it even more difficult for new airlines to break into the\
business.

In news on the Tampa refugees, the [courts\
are going to
rule](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2001/09/item20010917004942_1.htm) on
the Government\'s apeal today.
