First entry for 2001. A lot of things have happened.

I went on a holiday to Paris for a week and then Oxford\
for a week with the rest of my family. It was good, but a\
bit cold. I got to meet Mathieu while in Paris which was\
good.

A few days after I got back, I was back on the plane for\
Sydney (where I am writing this) for
[linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/). It starts\
on Wednesday, and should be a lot of fun.
