Put out another [development\
pygtk
snapshot](http://www.gnome.org/~james/pygtk2-SNAP-20010613.tar.gz). I
actually released it yesterday, but\
my computer\'s clock was out by 12 hours when I made the\
release, but didn\'t notice it (something weird must have\
happened when bringing all the computers back up after the\
brownout on sunday), and the ntp server on the gateway\
didn\'t start up correctly so it didn\'t correct itself. I\
hate clock skew.

I have some ideas on how to decrease the amount of\
handcoded stuff in pygtk even further. The beginnings of\
this code is included in the latest snapshot (the GBoxed\
type). I haven\'t gotten round to converting any of the\
existing boxed types over to this new code or adjusted the\
code generator yet though.

Cyrille, Lars, Steffen and Hans have been doing great\
work on [Dia](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/). They\
are responsible for most of the work on the recent 0.88.1\
release of dia. There will probably be a 0.89 release soon.

[Chema](http://www.advogato.org/person/Chema/) posted an initial tarball
of glade\
v2. I will have to look at it a bit closer. Libglade will\
have to be ready for the gnome 2.0 API freeze, which will\
probably be before glade2 is usable. The Sun guys want\
accessibility support in glade/libglade, so we will see how\
that shapes up.

At the office, I was attempting to get the amanda backup\
client agent to compile under cygwin (with the aim of adding\
some NT boxes to the network backup system). After patching\
it to take into account \".exe\" suffixes on some programs and\
commenting out some of the fstab/block device code, it\
finally compiled. By hooking it up to cygwin\'s inetd, the\
amcheck, amdump, etc programs on the backup server could\
talk to the client agent on the NT box. Unfortunately, the\
backup was really slow and was using 100% CPU :( It sent\
the dump to the backup server, but then had to create an\
index or stats for the dump, or something, which was taking\
a long time and caused a timeout :(

Cygwin is a very useful tool on windows boxes, but it has\
its limitations. I found out about an [Amanda\
Win32 client](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/amanda-win32/) which I
might try. It uses yet another\
POSIX emulation layer.
