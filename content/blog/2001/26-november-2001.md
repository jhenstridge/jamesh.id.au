Working at ActiveState was a lot of fun. It was\
interesting working on Komodo, and learning about the\
Mozilla code base.

I got to feed the useful mozilla fixes back upstream that\
was good. I got [bug\
107651 - Handle multiple file drops on mozilla (gtk build)\
using the text/uri-list
target](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107651) into the
0.9.6 release\
(which is not as useful as it could be, due to many mozilla\
dnd observers not being set up for multiple item drops).

I have a few other useful patches pending:

-   [bug\
    109798 - support multi item text/x-moz-url drags as\
    text/uri-list on
    mozilla/gtk](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109798)
-   [bug\
    69528 - support attaching multiple files at once via
    dnd](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69528)
-   [bug\
    37685 - get postscript printing to use more than just
    Times](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37685)

Hopefully some of these will get into 0.9.7.

The weather was great on the weekend. Went out\
kneeboarding with some friends. We put together a two metre\
tower high on the back of the boat built from two spars\
lashed together. It looked a bit dodgy, but it worked\
pretty well. It made getting up on the board a lot easier\
(it was my first time kneeboarding in over a year, and I was\
expecting to fall off almost immediately).
