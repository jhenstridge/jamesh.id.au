It is really sad hearing so many people in the US out for
blood (I have no way to tell how many people feel this way
\-- the internet+media can give a very skewed perspective on
things). The terrorists killed many innocent people in the
WTC, most likely because of issues they had with the US
govenment and foreign policy. If the US turns around and
kills innocent Palestinians or Afgahns (or where ever they
happen to be based) in order to get the terrorists, that
would be just as bad an act of terrorism.

In local news, [Ansett](http://www.ansett.com.au) has stopped
flying, which means the only interstate domestic airline
serving Perth now is Qantas. I hope the [ACCC](http://www.accc.gov.au)
keeps air fares in
check.

It seems that even though Judge North [ruled
in
favour](http://theage.com.au/news/national/2001/09/12/FFXAIY3LGRC.html)
of the Tampa refugees, they are still going to
Nauru until the government is finished apealing the
judgement. I don\'t know anyone who approves of how the
government treats boat people.
