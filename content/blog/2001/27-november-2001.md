My arms are still a bit sore when I straighten them from\
the kneeboarding. I guess I need to get a bit more\
excercise.

I was setting up an Adaptec 2400A RAID card today. It\
came with a bootable configuration CD, which was pretty\
convenient. I put it in the drive, and see a LILO prompt,\
and it booted Linux, and started X.

There was a little program that gave access to the RAID\
config program, documentation, the ability to set up driver\
disks for various operating systems. The last option was to\
start an RXVT, so I chose that. Looking at the ps listing,\
I noticed that the GUI was actually a python program using\
[PyGTK](http://www.advogato.org/proj/PyGTK/), which was a nice surprise.
It is nice\
seeing my code being used in small applications like this.
