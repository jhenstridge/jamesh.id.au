Assuming that the initial count is correct, /me is on the\
[GNOME Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/)\
Board of Directors! (as soon as the results are verified).

As board members are evenly spaced around the globe (I am\
in +800, Telsa is in +100, many are in -500 and George is in\
-800), board meetings are going to be at inconvenient times\
for some people. At the moment, it looks like it is George\
who will be getting up at 8am for meetings, and at midnight\
for me. As I said I would make meetings difficult to\
schedule in my candidate statement and George voted for me,\
I can\'t feel too sorry for him `:-)`

Congratulations to all the other new board members.
