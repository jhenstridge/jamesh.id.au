In Melbourne for a month working for
[ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/) on\
Komodo, which is pretty interesting. I am supposed to be\
fixing linux/gtk related bugs. It is quite difficult to\
work out where in the mozilla source code things are\
happening though `:(`.

Komodo is a very interesting project, and should mature\
into a good IDE (it is already usable under windows). Some\
great free software has come out of Komodo already (even if\
Komodo itself isn\'t), such as PyXPCOM.
