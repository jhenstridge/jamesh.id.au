At the June 2022 Perth Linux Users Group meeting, I gave a talk about
building websites with the [Hugo static website
generator](https://gohugo.io/).

It included a quick rundown of some of Hugo's features, an overview of
how to build a site, and some options to host the site for free. This
was followed by a demo and questions from the audience.
