Problems with this setup

Menu structure defined by code
if you want to rearrange menu structure, you need to rearrange the code
sometimes causes problems with signal connections, etc
To enable or disable a user action, you must alter the state of the GtkMenuItem or toolbar button.
if you have multiple ways of performing the action, you need to alter all widgets.
Doesn't even attempt to handle things like menu merging
