Actions

Represent something the user can do
a callback (or more than one)
a label to use in menu items
maybe a shorter label for toolbar buttons
an icon
state (sensitivity, visibility, etc)
Can create an arbitrary number of menu items and toolbar buttons for an action
properties and state of menu/toolbar items mirror the action they represent
set action to disabled -> all widgets representing the action are disabled
Different types of actions (extensible)
