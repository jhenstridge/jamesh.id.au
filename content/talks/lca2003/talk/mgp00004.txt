Development Process (overview)

Pre-Gnome 1.0: development is fairly unstructured
Gnome 1.x: commit to providing binary compatibility
new features occasionally added
Gnome 2.x: move closer to providing forward and backward compatibility in a minor series of versions
2.0.x releases are bug fixes
2.2.x is bug fixes + new features (backward compatible).
