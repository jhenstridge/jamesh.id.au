Pre-1.0 Gnome Development

Development driven by what hackers were interested in
Many people with check in privileges, but no strong standards for what to check in to the development platform (other than "doesn't break the build").
Resulted in a lot of good ideas along with many bad ideas
Was not a great platform to recommend other people base apps
