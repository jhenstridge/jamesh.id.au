EggMenu

Existing menu and toolbar handling API in GTK  is not sufficient for advanced programs.
Bonobo has a more full featured API, but has some issues
API is quite different to GTK API, so is a barrier to porting apps to Gnome
Requires use of CORBA, which is not always desired.
Want an API in GTK that:
satisfies needs of larger applications
simple to use so that it doesn't look too heavy for small applications
flexible enough that it can be extended to do what component systems and compound document systems need it to
