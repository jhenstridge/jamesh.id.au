Usability problems:
not obvious what the widget is, does or represents
I18N problems:
new_with_color() and set_color() are bad, because different colours have different meanings to people.
set_type() has the potential for localisation
Accessibility problems:
colours is not a good medium to communicate information to people
blind users, colour blind users, etc.
The set_color() variant does not follow desktop theme.
There are almost always better ways to provide information
