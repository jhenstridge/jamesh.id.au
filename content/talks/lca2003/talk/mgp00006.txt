The 1.x Platform

Something that other people could develop against.
Some cruft removed from platform libraries
Keep stuff that was actually being used, and we would be able to maintain
Maintained backward compatibility throughout 1.x series.
most new features were implemented in new releases of the platform, but not all.
(eg. some packages would require gnome-libs-1.2.3 because they used a 5 line function that was added in that release).
