    <h1>The Future</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A python scripting interface is currently being developped.
        This will allow programatic manipulation of diagrams, and with
        the properties interface should be powerful enough to generate
        XMI from Dia UML diagrams, for instance.
      <li>Bonobo support is planned for the future.  This will allow
        embedding Dia diagrams in other Gnome Office applications, and
	make it easier to embed Dia in other applications (such as a
	CASE tool).
