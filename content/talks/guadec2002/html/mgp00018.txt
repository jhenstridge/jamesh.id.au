Generators

Rewriting tasks to be run by the main loop as idle tasks is tedious and error prone.
Use generators!

        from __future__ import generators
        import gtk

        def task_generator():
            for i in range(100):
                print i
                yield gtk.TRUE # yield control to main loop
            yield gtk.FALSE    # task complete

        gtk.idle_add(task_generator().next)

State saved automatically between invocations of idle function.
