Unicode

Python 1.6 and 2.0 introduce unicode string type
if a function expecting a normal string gets passed a unicode string, it gets converted to the "default" character encoding
PyGTK sets default character encoding to UTF-8 at startup
you can pass unicode strings to PyGTK functions/methods, and they will be handled by GTK correctly
Following code will work as expected:
w = gtk.GtkLabel(u'2\u03D6r')
