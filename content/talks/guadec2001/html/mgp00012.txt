GSignal and GClosures

New signal system uses closure objects which wrap up a function, user data and marshallers.
gobject module allows connecting handlers to signals, and adding signals to GObject classes.
Signal system lets us set a closure as the class handler for a signal type
signals defined in python can do just as much as ones defined in C code.
