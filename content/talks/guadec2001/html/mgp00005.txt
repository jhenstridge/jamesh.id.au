The Rewrite

Chose to rewrite bindings
use ExtensionClass
new defs file format
new code generator
remove the procedural interface
add evil hack to give single wrapper per object
Was not possible to keep compatibility with all the changes.
decide to target binding at GTK 2.0
abandoned ExtensionClass based GTK 1.2 binding available on extension-class-branch branch
