Problems with Current Bindings

Possible to have multiple wrappers for each GtkObject
this model was chosen to avoid circular references
object oriented interface built on top of procedural interface
Non trivial ammount of python code to interpret on startup (takes time)
Not easy to extend for extra libraries of widgets
Procedural intermediate interface is not used much -- just takes up memory and diskspace
