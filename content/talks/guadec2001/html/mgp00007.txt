New Defs Format

Defs files are used by language bindings as prototypes for functions provided by the library
composed of s-expressions
used by Guile, Python, Perl and PHP gtk+ bindings
Old defs format lacks some useful information
only defines object heirachy, and functions
doesn't link functions to classes as methods
New defs format has more information
original specification by Havoc
makes class <-> method relationships explicit
more type information
Takes guess work out of code generation
