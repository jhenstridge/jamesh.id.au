In 2000, I was completing the honours year of my Bachelor of Science
at [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/).
The project was a [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package designed
to help with Markov Chain Monte Carlo spatial problems.

The project was supervised by Adrian Baddeley and Alice Niemeyer.

The main result of the project was my honours thesis and the
associated GAP package:

* [GASP: A Computing Framework For Markov Chain Monte Carlo Spatial Problems](thesis.pdf)
* [`gasp.tar.gz`](gasp.tar.gz) (probably out of date with today's GAP)

I also gave a presentation about the project, the slides of which are
here:

* [GASP (slides)](talk.pdf)
