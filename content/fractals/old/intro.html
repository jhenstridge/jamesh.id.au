    <H1>What is a MandelBrot Set</H1>
    
    A Mandelbrot Set is a Fractal formed by iterating the function <i>z
    = z<sup>2</sup> + c</i> for each point <i>c</i> on the complex plain.
    The points on the complex plane, where the value of <i>z</i> never
    get further from the origin than two units are said to be part of
    the Mandelbrot Set.  Since we would never be able to iterate the
    function infinitely, we set a maximum number of iterations and say that
    if this number is reached, the point is in the set.  The colour scheme
    comes from the number of iterations required for a number to escape from 
    the origin circle.  This means that points with the same colour took the
    same number of iterations to escape.
    
    <p>This particular Mandelbrot Set Generator is very limited, since it has
    a low number of iterations and can't zoom, and is very hard to extend.
    If you want a better one, see the other one, which is number 3 on the
    main page.  It can do all this and also does Julia Sets.
    
    <p>This applet can take only one parameter: <code>resolution</code>. 
    This sets the size of the pixels used. (ie. big numbers mean the set
    looks more blocky, but generates faster.)
