    <h1>What is an IFS fractal</h1>

    <p>IFS stands for <dfn>Iterated Function System</dfn>.  Fractals
    of this type are created by applying one of a number of functions,
    chosen randomly from the rules set up for the IFS, repeatedly to
    an intitial point, and graphing each new point.  For more
    information on the functions used, see the page on <a
    href="formula.html">IFS formulas</a>.  With IFS fractals, it can
    be seen that the starting point does not effect the shape of the
    fractal too much.  This means that a particular fractal can be
    defined by the rules used to find the next point, and the
    probabilities that an individual function will be chosen.  This is
    the model used by my IFS fractal generator.</p>
