    <h1>How the Formula is Used</h1>
    
    <p>The formula used by the Complex Number Fractal Generator can be
    thought of as a function <var>f(z, c)</var>.  It is used to
    transform <var>z</var>, like so:</p>

    <div class="equation">z<sub>n + 1</sub> = f(z<sub>n</sub>, c)</div>

    <p>and is iterated until the modulus (absolute value or size) of
    <var>z</var> is greater than 2.  The point is then coloured
    according to how many iterations it took to escape.  This part of
    the routine is common to both Mandelbrot Sets and Julia Sets.  The
    diference is in the definitions of <var>c</var> and <var>z</var>.
    In a Mandelbrot Set, the initial value of <var>z</var> is 0, and
    the initial value of <var>c</var> is the point on the complex
    plane, while in a julia set, <var>z</var>'s initial value is the
    point on the complex plane and <var>c</var> is some constant.
    This means that there is only one Mandelbrot Set for a formula,
    while there is an infinite number of Julia Sets.  In fact, each
    value of <var>c</var> for a Julia Set, corresponds to a point on
    the Mandelbrot Set.  Points that are inside the Mandelbrot Set
    (the black bit) will give connected Julia Sets, while points
    outside will give disconnected sets, and points on the edge (eg. 0
    + 1i) will give Julia Sets with no area.</p>

    <p>Some formulas for implemented fractals are:</p>
