    <h1>Newton-Raphson type Fractal</h1>

      <applet code="Newton3.class" height="340" width="400">
        <hr />
        <p>If your browser supported Java, You would see a nice
        fractal here.</p>

    <p>This fractal is created by trying to solve the equation
    x<sup>3</sup> = 1, using the Newton-Raphson method.  This involves
    defining the function f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> - 1, and using it in an
    iterative formula which should converge to zero, thus finding a
    value of x which is a solution to the first equation.  This
    formula is:</p>

    <div class="equation">x<sub>n+1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> - f(x) /
     f'(x)</div>

    <p>Where f'(x) is the derivative of f(x).This fractal applies the
    formula to each point on the complex plain, and colours it
    according to how many iterations are required for f(x) to converge
    (approximately) to zero.  In the fractal, the bottoms of the
    basins (boring regions of the fractal) are actually solutions of
    the origional equation.</p>

    <p>Since this fractal doesn't have a julia set equivalent, I made
    the julia set of this fractal do the same type of fractal but on
    the equation x<sup>3</sup> = c.</p>
