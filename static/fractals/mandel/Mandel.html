    <h1>Classic Mandelbrot/Julia Set</h1>

        <p>If your browser supported Java, You would see a nice
        fractal here.</p>

    <p>The Mandelbrot Set is probably one of the most well known
    fractals, and probably one of the most widely implemented fractal
    in fractal plotting programs.  It was originally discovered by
    Benoit B. Mandelbrot, hence the name.  It is produced by the
    formula</p>

    <div class="equation">z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>
    + c</div>

    <p>where z and c are complex numbers, z<sub>0</sub> = 0, and c is
    a point on the plain.  The formula is iterated until
    |z<sub>n</sub>| (the magnitude of z) is greater than or equal to
    the bailout value 2.  Then the pixel that c corresponds to is
    coloured according to the number of iterations that occured before
    the process bailed out.  The uninteresting black area of the image
    is the actual Mandelbrot Set.  It consists of all the values for c
    where |z<sub>n</sub>| never got larger than 2.  Of course this
    area is impossible to comute accurately, so this program decides
    to colour black all pixels for which |z<sub>n</sub>| never gets
    larger than 2 for a given number of iterations (256).</p>

    <p>It is amazing that such a simple formula can produce such an
    interesting picture.  If you zoom into the image (click zoom and
    drag out an area on the image) you will find sections that look
    the same as portions of the image at other zooms.  This infinite
    level of detail is common to all fractals and makes them so
    facinating.  If you find that the image is too blocky for your
    liking, you can change the resolution by choosing a different
    number from the list box on the left of the controls (The smaller
    the number, the smaller the pixels will be) and press the redraw
    button.</p>

    <p>By now you are probably getting bored of this fractal, but
    don't change to a different one yet; there is still an infinite
    number of Julia Sets to look at.  Julia Sets are produced with the
    same formula as the Mandelbrot set, but the starting values are
    different.  That is c is some constant, and z<sub>0</sub> is the
    starting point on the plane.  From this definition, you can see
    that there is an infinite number of Julia Sets; one for each value
    of c.  In fact, there is a Julia Set that corresponds to each
    point on complex plane.  There is an interesting relationship
    between the Mandelbrot Set and the Julia Sets.  In a way, you can
    think of the Mandelbrot Set as an index for the Julia Sets.  For
    values of c that are inside the Mandelbrot Set, you will get
    connected Julia Sets.  That is all the black regions are
    connected.  Conversely, those values of c outside the Mandelbrot
    Set, you get unconnected sets.</p>

    <p>Because of this relationship, I have written the applet so you
    can switch over to a Julia Set by just clicking on the "Switch
    (M&lt;-&gt;J)" button and clicking on part of the set.  You will
    notice that the coordinates of the pointer are displayed on the
    status line during selection.  To get back to the Mandelbrot Set,
    just click on the button again.</p>

    <p>By thinking of the Mandelbrot Set as an index for Julia Sets,
    the question comes up about what happens if a point on the edge of
    the Mandelbrot Set is chosen as the value of c.  The answer is you
    get a null set.  That is there should be no black section.  If you
    have trouble finding a point on the edge of the set, try the point
    (0, 1).  This is one of the few points on the edge of the
    Mandelbrot Set with rational coordinates which is why I name it.
    Have fun exploring!</p>
