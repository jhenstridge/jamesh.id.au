    <h1>What Does This Applet Do</h1>
    
    <p>This set of applets are built on an extendable fractal engine.
    It is capable of zooming in on the fractal, changing the
    resolution, from within the applet, and switching between
    Mandelbrot and Julia Set equivalents.</p>
    
    <p>It is so easily extendable, you can create another applet that
    extends the original Mandelbrot applet to use a different formula,
    without any loss in functionality, and by only writing about 10
    lines of code.  Some examples are available on this site,
    including the Mandel3, Mandel4 and Phoenix fratal types.  These
    three include source code.</p>
    
    <p>In the box at the bottom of the applet, there are a number of
    controls.  The first is a list box, which allows you to select the
    resolution.  The last three are buttons; the first just redrawing the
    set, the second allowing you to select a region with your mouse, and
    the last alows you to switch between Mandelbrot and Julia Set
    equivalents.  If you are switching to a Julia Set, it will prompt you
    for a point, to use as <i>c</i>.</p>
    
    <p>The applet can take a number of parameters.  These are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>top, bottom, left, right</kbd></dt>
        <dd>These parameters specify the window to use.</dd>
      <dt><kbd>type</kbd></dt>
        <dd>This specifies whether to do a Mandelbrot or Julia Set.  Its
        value must be mandel or julia.</dd>
      <dt><kbd>creal, cimag</kbd></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the real and imaginary parts of <i>c</i>.  Only
        effective if <kbd>type = julia</kbd>.</dd>
      <dt><kbd>maxiter</kbd></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the maximum number of iterations.</dd>
      <dt><kbd>resolution</kbd></dt>
        <dd>Specifies the initial resolution.  Must be 1, 2, 5 or 10.</dd>
      <dt><kbd>nocontrols</kbd></dt>
        <dd>If set to true, the controls are not displayed at the bottom of
        the screen.</dd>
