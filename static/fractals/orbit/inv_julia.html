    <h1>Inverse Julia Set</h1>
    
    <div class="fractal">

    <p>This applet draws standard Julia Sets in a non standard, but
    quicker way.  To understand this method, first lets look at the
    standard method.  Using the standard method, if the point you are
    calculating the colour for is inside the set, then it will stay
    inside the set, no matter how many times you apply the iterative
    formula.  In other words, that point is 'attracted' to the Julia
    Set.  Points outside the set, however, rapidly increase in
    magnitude after subsequent iterations.  That is, they are
    'attracted' to infinity.  Either way, by applying the iterative
    formula, the point is 'repelled' from the edge of the set.</p>

    <p>But what if we used the inverse of the formula?  Then no matter
    where we started, this inverse formula would move towards the edge
    of the Julia Set, and away from the interior of the set, and
    infinity.  This in effect gives us a tracing of the boundary of
    the Julia Set.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the inverse of the Julia Set function is z =
    plus or minus square root of (z - c).  (I will use real HTML when
    MATH tags are properly supported) As you can see this is not a
    true function, since it has two values, but instead forms a binary
    tree.  That is, after n iterations, we have 2<sup>n</sup> values
    of z.  By using a recursive function, it is easy to walk through
    this binary tree and plot the function.</p>

    <p>If you want to plot a different Julia Set, wait till the
    current one is finished (a copyright message apears on the status
    line), then click somewhere on the applet.  To make the selection
    of starting point easier, The coordinates of the mouse are
    displayed on the status bar.  Some values you might want to try
    are (-0.74543, 0.11301) and (0, 1).</p>

    <p>Note: The algorithm for this applet was swiped from fractint, as a
    lot are, but the code is all my own.</p>
