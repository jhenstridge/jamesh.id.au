    <H1>Orbit Fractals</H1>
    Orbit fractals are formed by choosing a starting point, and repeatedly
    applying a transformation, or orbit formula, to it, and plotting the
    subsequent points.  This is how most of the orbit fractals in this
    section work, with the exception of fractal popcorn.  It applies the
    orbit formula for more than one starting point.  In fact, it applies it
    for every tenth pixel (I know that this is different from how Fractint
    does it, but doesn't it look a lot nicer? :)
