\chapter{Conclusion}

The GASP package should prove to be a useful tool for simulation of
spatial statistical processes.  The package is designed to be as
extendable as possible, I expect that it will become more useful in
the future as more algorithms are added to the library accompanying
GASP.

In hindsight, it may have been a better decision to choose a different
language.  Parts of the framework that required floating point support
could only be tested by people who had access to the development
version of \GAP, as there are no publicly released versions of \GAP{}
with floating point support.  Once the next version of \GAP{} is
released, this barrier will be removed.

If GASP is too slow to run a simulation, \GAP{} comes with a \GAP{} to
C translator, which can increase the speed of a program.
Alternatively, GASP can be used to explore an algorithm, before using
another program to perform a longer simulation.

I plan to add some more features to GASP and submit it as a share
package for \GAP.
